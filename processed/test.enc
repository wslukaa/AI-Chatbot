Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Cameron.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
That's because it's such a nice one.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
do you listen to this crap?
Wow
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Hey, sweet cheeks.
What do you think?
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
Patrick -- is that- a.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
I thought you hated those people.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Her favorite uncle
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
How'd you do it?
We don't chat.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
That's never been proven
I say, do what you wanna do.
I told you
You 're so --
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Oh huh
Hi.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Say it
What?
Ever been to Club Skunk?
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
... and also to bring medicine.
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
That's what it says.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
The ocean is uncrossable?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
Don't say anything.
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Are you married?
Is he your boyfriend?
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
What are you doing?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
What was that, Korfin?
What's he looking for?
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
No, what is it?
Nah, I musta missed it.
My folks are.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
I'm serious here.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Hey.  I'm a professional.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
I am butcher.
How much money are you carrying with you?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
How long are you planning to stay?
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
In here, says he wants a million.
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
What?
Sit down!
Traitor!!
We spent it!
What are you doing here?
Isn't he a little moody?
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Yes...he's my friend.
New York.
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
What?
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
How was it?
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
CONTINUED
Yes.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
Oh?
How?
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
CONTINUED
When are you coming home?
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Thank you, Daddy.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
That's true.
I understand.
Now how's your memory doin'?
I never paid for it in my life.
What's the matter with my place?
Would you guys...
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
No way to start a partnership.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
Now, where we goin', convict?
I don't give out the details.
Well?
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
Half a million.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
Where's luther?
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
How did they get away?
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
I'm all wet.
What'd you do?
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Thanks for the coffee.
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
You real down?
How do you know?
Hard man to live with.
What do you want?  What's goin' on?
Keep stallin'.
How hot are they?
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
When?
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
So you do know her.
They really made her...
Yeah?
I don't need one.
The Fifth Element...
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
You little sleaze bag!
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
30 seconds...
6... 5...
...Hi.
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Yeah, very big, a giant.
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
What mission?
And the third one?
I've had enough good news for today
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
You know women normally change five times more than men.
I told you not to read all that crap!
The wind blows... the fire burns...
At least I won lunch.
The cash man!
This thing solid?
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Welcome home.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
You're killing me...
Dino...
And they are?
I want to watch you work.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
Celebrity Films.
Eddie.
What's he talking about?
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
What do you want?
I don't know...
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
That's right.
They're no friends of mine.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Who is he, his name?
You don't need to be here.
What's next?
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
You... you need to go to the police.
I'm not positive this means anything.
One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
How... how can you say that to me...?
Who is this... ?
Who are you?
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
None too discreet, is he?
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
No, you may not.
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
We'll figure it out.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
Kristen, what happened?
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
Rick, please.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
But how...?
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
Since my little girl became a mom...
Alice!
But Dad --
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
What is it?
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
I guess.
Cyclops?
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Under <u>water</u>?
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
Well, I'll be - !
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Who?
Twombley involved?
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
You heard the news.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
Yeah.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
Don't mind if I do.
No brag. Just fact.
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Like you and Gordon?
Bastard's got his high beams on.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
Open the door, will ya?
Those are the Hoyts.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
But it's not funny now.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Yes.
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Are we going in this?
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
You? Why?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
I know who it is.
You okay?
Forget it.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
Can --?
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
What the hell are you talking about?
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Yes. Here's your ticket.
Something about my father?
The other guy.
Yeah.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Bang!
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Find them everywhere. 
Which is?
Then who shot him?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
I'm sorry, honey.
Did we warn them off?
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Why?
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
Tower, here.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
What do you want with us?
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Four...
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
Excuse me?
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
I was reading too.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
There's nothing wrong with me!
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
What are you doing, Ted?
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Ted!
Set!
I mean for Ted.
Simon.
Have you got it straightened out now?
You can do it from up here, Captain.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
No.  Poached.  Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
Captain Oveur?
You folks need any help?
You can't go in there!
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
George Zipp said that?
Can't you take a guess?
Well...not for another two hours.
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
A hospital? What is it?
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
And a little ice.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
We have a visitor.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
He didn't recognize me.
Kill them both.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Tell me.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
I believe he is probably lying.
You are married?
Your health...
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
Uh, George...
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
What kind of test?
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
What?
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
You son of a bitch.
What's he scanning for?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
I don't know.
Sir?
Alive?
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
And how are we today?
I don't want you for a friend.
Why not?
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
How do you know?
Sir -
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
That's stupid.
Ui-vol-i-tub!
I don't know.
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Why not? Half the house!
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
I'm not telling you.
Go back to bed.
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
What?
Why you?
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
When, may I ask?
He's adorable!
I said play!
Really?
It's just a trifle, of course.
And the result satisfies.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Do you like this, Salieri?
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
Twenty-six.
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
Is she not here?
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Oh, thank you, sir.
What medicine?
Is he working?
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Wolfi!
Can I see it?
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
Mio caro Adone.
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
But what is it they don't like?
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
Did my work please you?
Yes?
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
This is only a vaudeville.
The doctor thinks I am. But -
What?
Shall I answer it?
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
Confutatis Maledictis.
We ended in F Major?
Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
Are they?
You cannot say that!
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Yes?
You mean that play?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Here I am, my angel.
I can't wait.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
That lady is back, sir.
Herr Salieri.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Go about your duties.
What exactly did he call out?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
The zoo? Is he rational?
It wasn't a lunatic.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
What? Oh, yes, please.
Will you come with me?
What?
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Not just a patient -- me.
I'll let you know the next full moon.
Charming.
Tomorrow is the full moon.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
David, what are you doing?
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
Hello, Benjamin.
How are we feeling tonight?
Miss Price.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
How long have I been here?
There were witnesses?
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
I assume full responsibility.
Go on, ask them.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
I heard that.
Yeah?
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
You really scared me, you shithead.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
We were attacked by a werewolf.
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
What about the zoo?
Because this must be stopped.
You were saying?
Do you have any hot soup?
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust—
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't—
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
Well—
Don't you know?
No.
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
The theatre?
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
Good morning.
You haven't got a uniform?
Looks good. How much did it cost?
No. I won't.
The lobby's half filled now.
Mine too?
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
No.
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
Are you sure?
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
What time was it?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Everybody in?
Where's Charlie?
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
You can ride like that?
What have you done?
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
The Army can hang him.
How many of them did he kill?
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
Not now.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
They're gone. What are you --
He thinks this is some kind of game!
You're doing just fine.
How'd it go in there?
You've killed your fair share of men.
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
Yeah, Jimmy?
You're sick of my company?
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
You didn't want to farm?
Let me see that.
Don't turn around.
What?
Don't swear.
You cocky little bastard.
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
I think so.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
Not at all.
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
Good.
Your men knew the risks.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
Stop it. I'm...
Okay. Yeah. What time?
This is Dorsia?
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
Pull out.
Why?
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
That's nice.
Patrick?
You just haven't been looking.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
Yes, I am.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
No, you...didn't?
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
Uh huh.
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
Don't, I'll drink it.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
Dorsia, yes?
Just...say...no.
Yes?
Who?
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
Interesting.
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
No.
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
KIMBALL.
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Where did you go to school?
Pardon me, but are you okay?
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
No.
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
That's not the information I've received.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
Marcus?
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
Listen, what's your name?
Al.
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Oh well, you know.
Hey, Halberstam?
No, Owen.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
No way. You have this -- destiny.
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Teddy was killed last night.
You can't just walk in, either.
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
Milo?
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
What?
Milo? I'm Danny.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
...Do I?
What're you implying.
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
The wrong place?
Let's go.
Gary?
You do?
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
...You wanna work -- here?
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
Time?
A what?
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
Why were you snooping in my office?
What'd he say?
Oh.
What?
Jesus, Teddy.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
Or sometimes not at all.
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Thank you.
Be careful.
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
What's the other?
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
Excuse me?
My wedding tackle.
What?
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
I can't see a bloody thing.
Fancy a nibble?
I am not.
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
I love you, Austin.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
That's not mine.
Is it one of ours?
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Right.
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
Did you ever...
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
You don't say. How real does it feel?
There are limits?
Nature ...
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Quite a collection.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
Hmmm ...
I'm already married ...
Valentine, listen to me ...
1922. Why the kippers?
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
I must say, you look more your old self --
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
For you, Mrs. Peel.
Is that what you think?
Barely.
Mmm ... what are you doing?
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Mrs. Peel?
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Decontamination -- ?
Peter's brother?  But --
Getting to what?
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
Think she really killed those agents?
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
In your operation.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
That's what we're going to find out...
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
All right!
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
Hello?
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
Yes, sir, I am.
Cole?
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
God, you're a slob.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
Good...
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
C'mon, I knew it was you.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
I don't believe you.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
Gary, you're quite an animal.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
What the hell are you doing?
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
It's on the tenth floor.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
About what?
Who?
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
Wash it to the windows?
You know Knowlton pretty well?
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
Did you do it for Tim?
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
It works.
Yeah? What about Laura --
-- C'mon, Stephen.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
Brian, look --
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Hey.
Okay.
Thanks for the invite.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
You could check. It'd be in his files.
That's a dumb thing to say.
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
The outlets.
Glass?
But the right guess on this is arson.
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Aren't you even curious?
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
The great communicator.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
Who's this?
You don't know him.
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
Don't you have any leads at all?
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
I forgive you.
I want 15 on the Mets.
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
YEAH!
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
Delacroix.
You don't have the demographics.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
We're ready when you are.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
We was coming to see you.
But the line has to be drawn.
I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Yep, you guessed it.
I don't know about that plantation angle.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
What do you want?
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
Let's get him over to the bed.
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
This is the group I was telling you about.
Why'd you do that?
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
Money and nothing else?
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
You tellin' the truth.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...too early...
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
No, before my time.
Just ask me what you want to know.
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
That is none of your business.
What is the service, sir?
And his baggage?
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
I'll match any man with the sword.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
All Europe shall hear of this!
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
I believe they will deport you.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
Did you buy the horse, papa?
Yes, he's fine.
He is only curious to know who you are.
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
You smoke, Ray?
And he'd been shot.
Do what?
Epilepsy.
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
Sir, yes, sir!
He wouldn't kill anybody...
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Bullshit.
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
You're lying --
Full clip to the body --
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
Maybe --
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
Nevertheless --
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
I'm sorry, Bill.
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Yes.
Move him.
That is the most unprofessional --
What is that?
I plan to grow on you.
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
I didn't shoot West...
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
Really.
Nah.
I should probably write that down.
How?
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
You were expecting me?
Will.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
Promise me you'll come back.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
You were talking about your wedding.
What's your name, Giant?
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.
Did I ever tell you about how...
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
Son?
You say...
They're your favorite flower.
I was drying out.
Wait! I need those!
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
I'm going with you.
I need you on my side.
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
How did you get here?
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
How is he?
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
What do you mean?
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
Yes.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
Sorry. You've lost me...
Yes. I know.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
Tell me.
No. It is too judgmental.
No. It's not that.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
Oh Jesus.
I'm so sorry.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Yes.
Yes.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
So you're just going to be vindictive
In every sense. If at all possible.
Where's the restroom?
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
We'll pretend it never happened.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
What happened between you and the blonde?
I've got news for you. It's not working.
Nobody's that unhappy.
Yeah. No thanks.
Okay. Goodbye.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
What are you doing?
Then start taking them seriously.
You hurt it?
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
You take her to a doctor?
That'd be nice.
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
What do you need?
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
That's not right, really, cuz I...
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
The fuck you laughin' at?
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
Or what? OR WHAT?
Don't need none.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Why you got me chained?
How you let men treat ya like they do?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
We drinkin' buddies now?
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
Yeah, gal I been here before.
Sorry.
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
You need some weed?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
What'chu sayin'?
What'chu sayin'?
He tapped that.
Goin' dove huntin'?
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
Keep the change on that.
What's on your mind?
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
Are you wasted?
I just wanted some make-up.
The hell you call me?
I think she got to you, pappy.
... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
Maybe we should do something?
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
Joyce can be nice.
What'd she say?
You cool, Ich?
All right, how's the new partner?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
You'll take care of that.
Where do we start looking for this guy?
Why weren't you at the platform?
Know her?
What's he saying?
Did I say that?
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
She disappeared... shit!
No...
Yes...
Think we'll get him, Nick?
We can't lose.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
Where's Ich?
And I'm supposed to care?
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
She's such a long way home for you.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
I planned on catching him, Captain.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
What's this?
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
With these?
If I say no?
Good.
Not to be trapped.
Would you like to be modified?
But not to last.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
What, Sebastian?
Show me something?
He could?
He's not ready yet.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
You got a machine on it yet?
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
Yeah.
Not if it works.
I think I have no money.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Shot of vodka, please.
Prosit.
How old am I?
I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
Meaning?
You're going to be over the limit.
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
How do you mean 'exploited'?
Are you for real?
It's a good job.
Jeezus!
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
Are you apprehensive?
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
Do I make you nervous?
They probably want to find out when they were made.
Where is he?
Did you cry when your father died?
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
They could clean around the arrangement.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
Uh-huh.
What's a long time?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
What difference will it make?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
I don't have one.
I'm Adam Webber.
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
It was amazing.
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
Heck, no!  What?!
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
Thank-Q!
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
This is for me.
Because I want to get married.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Of course.
You almost got us killed!
Um-hum.
He has a computer?
The guy with the underpants!
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Really?
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
I don't blame you!
But, Eve, I would--
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
Really?  Okay!
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
Is that a birthday cake?!
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulÈ!
What's baseball?
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
Why?
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
And thanks for always being happy!
Thirty-five.
You don't look thirty-five.
What?  What is it?!
The sky!!!
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
It shuts off automatically.
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
How long will we have to stay down here?
Then after that it's safe.
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
You have tranquilizers?
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
Hi, honey!
If we still have one.
Mutants?!
We do?
Well, I am the head of this household--
So where is your roommate, the model?
Give me your hand.
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
I don't think so.
Have him committed.
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Then you got undressed.
Yes.
Yes.
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
No.
Then don't talk about killing.
Nice guy. Who's he?
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
I want you to hurt me.
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
You what?
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
I want you to stay with me.
What?
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
It's okay. It's okay.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Frank gone?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
Hello?
Here's to Ben.
Okay Frank.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
No. No thank you.
No, you're right.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Am I bothering you?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
I've gotta go in.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
Now, how are you going to do that?
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
So, what's next?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
What's with Mike?
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
You better not, Jeffrey.
What am I going to do?
Jeffrey!!
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
Sandy?
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Anybody you think is evil?
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
They got nothing.
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
No ma! No!
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
For what?
What?
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
Yes.
So what do you think?
Now, you will receive us.
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
And the pennies?
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
Worst day of my life, man.
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
You feel?
You're right.
The... The funny man.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Continue the joke.
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
Fuck you Vincenzo.
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
He says. This is he.
Would they do that?
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
But he didn't say anything.
What's wrong with him?
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
See if mine are in there.
They don't?
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
This morning.
He told you and you let him do it.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
What?
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
How much?
Shut up!
When'd you get back?
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
What the fuck are we doing out here?
We all set?
I don't know.
It's going back down.
I don't know.
Come on.
I'll see you there.
I'll get him.
He did?
What do you mean?
You mean like techniques?
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
Congratulations. You passed the test.
What do you mean?
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
No, that door over there.
This is good.
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Hector woudn't do anything.
No, I don't mind.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
Give him a second.
Like silk?
Yeah.
Where'd they come from?
What's he doing here?
I don't know about that.
I'm not allowed to drive those.
It's true, Dignan.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
I warned you, Dignan.
I think we might of scared her.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
What the fuck possessed you?
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
Watch me.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
Come on, Bob.
Everything OK?
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
Hold on --
The grammar?
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Yes.
Why?
Where did he go?
Can't get it. It won't... 
We're closed, sir.
What?
No. Just pool.
Will it track back to us?
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
And?
Jesus...
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
You know I'm not.
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
-- car keys?
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
What if it's not who you think it is?
Why is she trying to kill me?
So when was I here?
Why am I alive?
Who's going? Us?
Still...
Let's give him half an hour.
It was in Latin, sir.
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
Longshanks promised!
What news of the north?
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
Wallace's followers.
Stephen ready?
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
Rest, William.
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
I wanna have supper waitin'.
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
Shall I leave, M'lord?
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
Thank you for inviting.
And I with you. But you must wake.
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
Darn it!
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
How. Did you. Know that?
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
Get out. Both of you.
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
I've stopped a hundred times.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
I know, but...
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
...yes.
Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
I couldn't cut the rope.
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
Destroy it?
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
Shut up, Tommy!
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
I won't.
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
Here you are.
Er, good luck, yes.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
Occupied France?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
What are they?
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
A franc for your thoughts.
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
Yes.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
No.
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
No.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
How do you do?
Your work.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
But we made a deal.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
Yes.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
I slept very well.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
Okay.
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
What friend?
Oh, thanks.
You're late.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
No.
You ever going to bed?
No.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Nobody remembers that.
Save some for tomorrow.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
Take it, damn it.
Fix raft first.
What are you doing?
Why do they have to die for me?
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
You don't seem too happy about it.
I got married.
What's that, written on the sail?
Anything else?
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
I didn't know we had sailboats.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
For the third time.
Hello?
How about we go somewhere else?
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
I need to do it.
Permission granted.
May I ask, where are you bound?
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?
Burma!
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
And what did she die of, exactly?
At least you were never lonely.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
I know, I'm sorry.
Do you think she'll be all right?
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
Wally thinks apples are boring.
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
Did you know your mother better?
No. She was an immigrant.
What's an immigrant?
Uh... it's the end of October.
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
Migrants?
What's that? What's it called?
Yes, for both.
In other words, scurvy.
Nobody's named this one yet.
I thought it was my turn.
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
Of course.
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
Where do you think you're going?
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Can --
Everything looks in order.
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
Know who I am, Jake?
Keeping the Fix happy.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
So how'd you get caught?
After you cut her loose.
Guess so.
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
Jake...
I'm going home
Moonan. Here. Shit...
Shit.
What? I can feel you looking at me.
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
How much?
Something stupid.
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
That's not --
Mr. King, I think --
I don't trust anyone.
You told me to change my hair!
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Do you have something to prove?
How do you deal with --
WHAT?
Sounds respectable.
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
Yeah.
You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
My fucking heart bleeds.
What?
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
To who?
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
Is it that bad?
Jack. Do you need a ride?
No. Thanks.
Maybe another time.
I hate cheats.
I can imagine.
What kind of deal you looking to?
What?!
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
I found her in bed with someone.
Who was he?
I get it.
And your lady?
You really are a beautiful woman.
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
That girl, she works at the casino --
You will?
Nothing about you.
Then what?
Found a job?
I've lived there.
Do you believe in astrology?
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
Toss you for it.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
I'm in trouble.
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
Do you?
Would you like a drink?
Nice car.
What the fuck are you talking about?
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
Where's the magnet?
Haven't you forgotten something?
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
I hope it's not the oven again.
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Energy shielding positive function.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Well of course I exist.
Exactly.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
In a second.
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
Veil nebula.
-- Remark.
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
Negative effect.
Doolittle, hello?
Commander? Are you still there?
We're running out of time, sir.
Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
That's not why we're here.
See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
Can I say something in my defense?
Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
They took my daughter.
Thank God.
Whoever that is.
Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
Bent.
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
You need to get out more.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
We're quoting Mom again.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
Who is it?
What do you want?
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
Say the words, "I understand."
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
As long as you're okay.
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
A little what?
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
So are dogs.
You get it when I get her.
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
She tells you how I've been--
How'd you get her out of town?
For a change.
Huh?
You love him?
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
You got in the car, didn't you?
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
...at twenty-thirty hours.
That's Sherry VanHafton.
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
No... You don't think...?
Dude, this is all I got.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
But, mom!
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
But we took the keys?
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
I don't even think you have a gun!
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
GOOD MORNING!
Yeah.
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
How much longer is this gonna last?
Why?
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
So, we call them... IMGs.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Hey.
Where is she?
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
People aren't that simple.
I know, Dad.
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
How are things going at school?
I think about girls a lot.
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
The good stuff.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
When will this happen?
Thank you.
What's her name?
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
I... What can we do?
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
Where is she?!
You're what?!
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Yah?
Go on! Get out!
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
All right, they're makin' a movie.
So? Be real easy.
Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant!  If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
That bitch from...
What?
Gladys! Stop it!
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
Nothin' too showy!
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
Here I am, Father.
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
But you're my father -
Yes, sir. 
Hey you!!
Well - what is he now?
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
You told it to me.
Send in the next girl. 
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.
Are you sure you're not tired?
Once more! 
I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
I don't remember.
Oh -- you mean... worm?
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
But -
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
They have noble faces.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
He fell.  He falls.
You've acquired a taste for this?
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
Has the response picked up?
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Tell me about it, please!
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
You alright?
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
The main spire.
Yyyess.
Hello...
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
Good morning.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Yes John?
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
I've heard.
No, he's very upset about something.
He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Well... where is he?
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
Yes.
No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
It was different...
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
We blew the Horn Resounding.
Really.
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
You don't love ME.
Well you started it.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
"But" what?
What's it all about?
You talking piffle, son?
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
Look, the sky is blue...
Now stop it!
Row!
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
Hey, you two! What's going on?
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
Sven!
No, I'm not.
Aaagh!
I'm not worth risking your life for.
Help!
Shut up!
But it's a responsibility...
I must KILL! Kill!
Shut up.
Oh, Tangerine.
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Joel? It's Joel, right?
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
You're sure? It's cold.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
Yeah.
So you like bookstores, huh?
Frost?
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
I'm fine.
What do you want to hear?
Thanks.
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
Let me drive you home.
So, um --
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
Joel!
Happy Birthday.
Do you remember what we talked about?
Right. Something black though.
I'd like to... take you out or something.
Well, you're married.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
I know.
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
I think she's great.
Male or female?
What if you stay this time?
Bye, Joel.
When?
I think I should go back.
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
That's okay. I --
Hey, Joel --
Doesn't sound like me.
So then she just stops calling.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
You have to stop this!
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
So you think the dissertation will get published?
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
You found us okay?
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
What's this?
Then why did you ask me?
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
Okay, we're back in.
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
He went home sick.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
Yeah?
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
Where are the others?
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
What is Debbie's position?
That's Jellybean!
How does she like what in bed?
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
For magazines?
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
From what?
Coop, where are you...
How? The Bridge is gone.
Please... kill...
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
What does?
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
Justin.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
We've got pressure.
Jesus its huge.
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
Captain Miller, I just want to say...
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
You said this ship creates a gateway...
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
Then who the fuck are you?
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
Everybody okay?
What's causing the readings?
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
I'll do it --
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
Yes.
What is it?
We're going to have to work on your touch.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Where is Reed?
About me? How sweet.
What is this? Where's Reed?
Ben?
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
You got a chisel round here?
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Hey! That's a prototype!
And where do we think we're going?
So are you!
Me like-y.
You're on fire!
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
This is wrong in so many ways.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
What?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
Ben's still out there --
Come on, Ben, come on...
It's just business.
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
Of course.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!
Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
I didn't say that.
Does Mom know you have company?
See you later.
Leave me alone!
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
Get a ride with somebody.
What's wrong?
What's going on?
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.
No.
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
And they don't call my parents?
Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
I thought he was out of town.
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
Don't you like him?
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
Well I never did it.
It was okay.
There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
Not coming? What happened?
You just ripped my card in two!
How about the point?
Do you know what you want?
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
I don't know.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
Really?
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
This is my granddaughter...
Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
What are you talking about?
I want to leave fast.
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
This is a fucking nightmare.
What is this?
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
Stop!
We should go! We should go right now!
Yeah.
We shot a skunk.
I think I know where a CB is.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
Fuck you too.
Scared?
What now, Geronimo?
We gotta be close.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
Really?
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
But --
Sure.
How much you got to see the show?
Huh?
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
What?
Seven.
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
Oh my God... What is that?
You know you don't have to do this.
Her name is Charlie.
I'll do anything to help.
Are you lying to me?
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
Well... come on.
Frances?  Oh no.
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
You know what I mean.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
An actress.
What does Clifford say?
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
But I'll never win that.
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
Oh, Kurt!
Address?
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
Just one minute...
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Harry.
Don't be a rat, Harry.
I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
Frances...
You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
The hell you will, Harry York.
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
How the hell do you find me anyway?
What for?
I took the early rounds.
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
What's that?
Frances, it's me, Harry?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
But I want to. I'm trying!
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
Where are you going?
I'll have lunch ready by one.
Say you promise.
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
Oh! Are you really?
Normal. Average.
What?
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
Frances, I'm warning you...
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
No! No!
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
It can't be as bad as that.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
Come warm yourself if you like.
Kill me and have done with it.
Kill you? Hardly that.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
What can I do?
Friend?
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
And if I consent?
Yes. I want this over and done with.
Poor William! What indignant tears!
I should go. I should leave today.
Your decision. For us.
My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
What sort of task?
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
Are you having me on?
Henry Clerval.
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
For what?
What happened up there?
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
Philosophical?
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
Preposterous.
Why?
Re-configure the leads?
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
How the... did he get in there?
How come?
I'm sorry.
Thanks.
Don't call him.
Are you wet?
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
What's this guy's problem?
You don't believe in suicide.
Jacob.
On the dresser.
In heaven.
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Yes.
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
I don't have the slightest idea.
Then?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
What's in Mexico?
Are you okay?
I'm sorry.
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
Richie? You okay?
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
Do they have an X-rated channel?
How do you know?
Is it me? Is it my fault?
What does that mean?
This ain't the time.
I don't know, you just passed out.
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
That's what you look like.
Yeah, it's mine.
They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
The woman I saw you with...
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
Of course, but there's more --
Thank you, sir.
I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
Oh, really.
Well.  'Least now we're talking the same language.  So one standard.  Is that what you're after?
Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --
Entering my scan now...
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
California.
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Uh, question, ma'am.
So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?
Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three...
Sir?
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Me?  Why me?
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
Who is it?
One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
O'Neil?
I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
Permission to get dressed, sir?
Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
Would you have shot if it was a man?
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
I think you're the liar.
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
Say again?  How many micks?
Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
Where's Audrey?
What?
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
Animal, I can't.
The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!
Are you okay?
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
Did Romeo have a name?
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Five bucks.
Did you talk with Humphries?
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
You don't understand, I can get us information...
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
Where's Luc and Pierre?
You're fast.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
It's the French Secret Service.
Why are you telling this to me?
Why do you need that?
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
It's Raymond.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Just don't.
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
You WILL go out there.
"The show must go on."
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
He wants to THINK!?
He's a miserable twit!
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
Why didn't you stop at the market?
We heard it the first time!
Alex? Where are you going?
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
It's okay. Listen-
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Yes...?
Yes Commander?
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
Lt. Madison, GO.
Up.
That's It?
What's the weather like outside?
It's suicide.
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
It's... I don't know.
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
They're gone.
But I'm the Commander!
Hey... Hey where are you going?
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
You know, that's really getting annoying.
Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
But there it is!...
Wh... Where are we?
Do your best, Tommy...
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
How about the pig-lizard?
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
Arnold!
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.
You, you just need a new flint, General.
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
What are we going to do?
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
What's your advice, Alexander?
Yes, I believe so.
Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
Detained by what?
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
You must be very rich.
These supplies...?
General Lee, sir!
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
Martha!  For God's sake!
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
I want you to see our hospital.
We're leaving them?
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
I see...
Juba was a Numidian.
I reserved a Cadillac.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
You get the money?
Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
And that's for the airport.
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
I'll find it.
She's great. Gimme the money.
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
The airport.
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Who?
What?
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
I'm a producer.
You have a card in here?
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
That's what I'm doing.
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
Come on, Harry -– Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
The shylock's the good guy.
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
One we're producing.
Whatta you think, Chill?
Who told you that?
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
It's not one of these?
We call you a taxi.
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
You okay?
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
How did you get in the house?
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Sixty pounds.
What's so great about Sweden?
I don't know. Tuesday?
The turbine blew.
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Ready?
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside.
Did you?
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
Dodge.  Dodge.
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
What's this?
How long?
Three, four days.
So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
Dodge to Murphy.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
What the hell happened!
If money can buy what he wants.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
Headache, nausea, lights?
You okay?
Go on.
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
What? What the hell're you talking about.
Are you sure?
What?
Nope.
The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
How's that?
If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
What now?
Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Better late than never.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Who?
Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
What?
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
I...
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
Forget it.
No.
Hi.
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Nothing.
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
Okay... I promise.
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
I might actually get the pasta special.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
You know, the green cardigan guy.
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
What? How long have you been standing there?
It's always closed...
JOSH!
I'll bet he never jerks off...
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
How about this one?
Ew ... when did you get that?
I know a party we could go to...
I don't believe you.
Like what?
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
Now are you going to get a regular job?
How repulsive!
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
I don't believe you.
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
Do you have any other old records besides these?
That's not even --
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
Good luck...
I'm totally serious!
Yeah, sure... very funny....
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
Yeah, but still...
I promise I'll take good care of it.
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
Aren't you going to get that?
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
Boo!
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
What's up?
Uh... sure... come in.
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
What?
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
I dunno, I...
I will if you want to.
No... forget it...
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
I agree.
Thank you, doctor.
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
You've never built in Africa.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Don't they, though?
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
What?
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer.
This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
That's a terrible idea-
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
Go, now.  Such a gentleman. 
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
Finish your tour?
Might be exciting for you.
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
Second death? Where?-
What a good week.
You mean nobody died?
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
...misfire... it jammed...
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
Why?
Did it look like this in your mind?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
You like him, don't you?
Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
He has children?
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
Oh no.
Do you ever see him?
Certainly.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
That's where the buggy stopped.
I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
I know.
Command me, lord.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
You've got to do something!
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
Get on with it, counselor!
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
You were the one who got me in.
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
You got a flux and a half.
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
Aren't you glad we waited?
Uuuuuuugh!!
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
That's a violin concerto.
Don't scream.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
Really!  Is it gone?
Has this ever happened before?
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
Are you Peter Venkman?
No, you may not.
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
Two wavy lines?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
Something was definitely here.
What do you mean "bad?"
You talked to Gozer?
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
What do we do now?
You'll never regret this, Ray.
Third floor.  Get down here,
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
Not yet, dear brother...
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...
Caesar?
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
He killed his father and then my family...
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
Serious stuff...
Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
Narcissus!
I killed too many barbarians.
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.
Hello.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Why not?
Could you do it?
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Yes.
That woman --
What?
Elaine --
GET OUT!
Don't cry. 
Well, I want you to leave.
Don't you have it on?
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
What?
Yes.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
We just can.
You really will?
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
657-2036
Hello -- who is this?
Yes, sir.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
You heard me. Out of here.
I'm in the bathroom.
Well here's the purse.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Where are you?
A single room or a double room?
What?
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
Will you come in, please?
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
Well I don't know.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
Why is it?
What?
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Do you want me to get it?
Well -- do you want to go up first?
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
Well.
Why don't you watch?
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Don't you?
No.
What?
What novel did you read.
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
Now let's keep going here.
No.
How many times a year.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Do you remember the make of the car?
Don't talk about Elaine?
Good.
I was just kidding around.
Then let's hear them.
Well, I'm not.
Are you?
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Sir?
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
Swell. I appreciate it.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
Quite a while.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
Hello.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
HUH?
Have you a minute now?
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
That.
Oh!
Reducing?
No -- why? -- should I?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
Grusinskaya --
I'll go -- good-bye.
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
No -- not at all.
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
A man might what?
Dance then? 
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
Yes.
What's the matter?
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
What...! --
Movies?
A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him.
Cotton Company --
Hello!
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
I mean with the Manchester people?
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
Shall I tell them again?
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
I'm cancelling the engagement.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
It is time for the performance.
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
Four minutes past. Please come.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
Next week.
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
That.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
You wanna talk to me straight up?
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
I certainly hope not.
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
Whadaya say?
So I heard.
So what's your story today?
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
I know you do, so that's why --
For God's sake, Lilly!
I don't see why not.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
A future. The only future I've got.
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
Where's the five?
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
That's just Lilly's way.
You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.
You already went back to work.
Nobody does that single-o.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
I thought these people were broke.
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
Where?
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
Yes, I know, I know.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
Carter.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
My god...
What the fuck are you talking about?
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
I think someone broke into my house.
Nothing's missing?
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
Forget it.
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
What?  Where is she?
Then you come out here.
You look kind of cold.
Better?
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
This kid just wants his freedom.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
What?
You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
Answer what?
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
God ... this can't be true.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
God, what's wrong with him?
What now?!
We need you, Dr. Loomis.
What is that?
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
You know what gets me?
At least!
Tell them yourself!
Go home!
So long, Colonel.
And how were things?
The educational process.
Go to the funeral?
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
I dunno.
Everybody thinks that.
If what?
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
You're making a joke.
Gee whiz--
You're hollow, like a woman.
As a matter of fact--
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
Everybody says he was so brave.
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
Oh hell.
Uck.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Dad--
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
How do you do?
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
Your old beau?
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
Harold!
I did?
You used to like it stark!
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
What then?
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
No you're not!
Why not?
It's a big and busy funeral home.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
If he thinks he's man enough.
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
Ooops.
Are you've seen it work cures?
It died for your sins.
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
Oooooo.  That hurt.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
The new hero is you.
You're too modest.
Here.  Finish the job.
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
Can't do it.
Thank you--for my life.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
It was a bitch.
Yes.
Because he was cruel?
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
Still lives with his mother.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
I don't really know.
Where will you be?
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
Everything stays as it is!
Don't worry about it.
He'd assume we had.
Yes?
Something happens to my confidence.
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
You figure!
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
What was it?
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
You're saying no.
The what?
It's suicide!
Everything's going to be beautiful.
Or get eaten alive.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'
You mean I'm black?
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
What are you doing?
Do you want to take a session?
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
You're still dressed?
Pull out your cock.
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
You want a tip?
Just one.
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
Is this all the display space we can get?
Where's he?
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.
How important do you think sex is?
Not very.
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
Yeah, yeah, go on.
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
Did you find out where she was?
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
Where is he?
Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
What are you paying me for?
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
That's like a stag film.
They're legal now.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
It's just a name.
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
Wes, do me a favor.
What plan?
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
Yeah.
What?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
You are at the University, Candy?
Yes, I am.
And what are you studying?
Eh, Poli Sci?
Yes.
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
But there is a family resemblance.
No.
Officer, I can explain.
Because if you are...
Harold?
How about some ginger pie?
It goes on and on.
What do you think?
What is it?
Oh, my. We're too late.
Thank you.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
No.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
Maude, do you pray?
Pray? No.  I communicate. 
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
Don't you advance on me.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
You sure have a way with people.
You should have been a poet.
"And this too shall pass away."
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
I don't care what people say.
Do you play?
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
Like a tea ceremony?
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
And why is that?
Fifteen.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
No.
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Yes, sir.
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
The moment of truth.
Will they really teach me to shoot?
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Yes.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
I knew you'd come.
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
WHY?
Kyle, you don't have...
I thought Steve had talked to you?
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
What the hell was that? An ape?
Don't look! Turn around.
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
What are you trying to say?
Thank you.
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
What took you so long?
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
Anything else you --
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
But it's not true, is it?
Hit me.
Pardon?
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
Just take it slowly.
What's happening?
Will you sign for the bed?
Got her mother's looks.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
Frank --
I'm brother Frank.
Julia.
Don't look at me.
Tell me who you are.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
You're hurting.
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
So you were cheated.
Sure.
I was here this afternoon.
We're going to freeze to death.
Just a thought --
Why didn't he want to sell it?
Can I get you anything?
Plain soda?
Please.
You want something to drink?
I... suppose so, yes.
Who brought me in here?
Kirsty?
Well I want you to see the house.
Great.
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
You will keep in touch.
Take care, Dad.
Never better. You sleep well.
I guess.
What?
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
I won't be able to stand.
Oh no?
Your father told me you were working here.
'Bye.
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
What's next?
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
What do you mean, "what?"
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
What the fuck is that?
Laura.  Her dad died.
Sonic Death Monkey.
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
Anna.
Anna Moss.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Right.  Why?
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.
Hey Rob.
What's this?
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Maybe I should talk to him.
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
Is it better?
Never?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
So, how are you?
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
Who the fuck's Pig?
I'm sorry.
I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
What about Ian?
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
Nothing.
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
I mean it.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Rob here.
What's happenin'.
What's the -- hey, Liz --
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
Sure.  Ten cents.
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
I warned you.
Happy birthday.
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
This is against the rules.
Yes.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
I don't know what you're talking about.
You have an active imagination.
Have you gone to the police?
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
No.
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
I'm not even sure why.
That would be difficult to explain.
Yes.
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
Now there's a new topic.
Thanks.
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
What's all of this got to do with me?
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Never take up poker, Detective.
Who is it?
Be quiet.
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Aye.
You're not from these parts.
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
He told me there could be only one.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
Impotent cow.
It will take less effort as you learn.
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing.
I feel hardly nothing.
You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
And you?
I am not ready for this.
Of course.
I'm your future husband, remember?
What would you like?
Stay out of it.
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
Figure she's with him?
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Spare a chair?
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
And if I refuse?
Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
A mystery.
His only kid.
Nothing to be sorry about.
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Who is it?
What's the idea of locking this?
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
No. Roy. Roy V.
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
All right, dear.
Hildy!
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
Well, I'll try to give her one.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
I'm beginning to realize that.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
The money? Why?
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
You can break it, can't you?
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
You've had a better offer, eh?
You bet I've got a better offer.
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
I'm not working for any other paper!
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
Say, could I meet him?
Then what does he want with you?
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
What now?
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
I know, but --
Double-crossing swine!
Look at me, Hildy --
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
Murder, uh?
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!
Where'd you wire him?
What!
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
How about Bruce's?
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
He's on my phone. He just called me.
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
You guys wanna play some more poker?
I'll call.
How's everything, Gus?
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
What?
Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
A sight for sore eyes!
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
Okay.  Forget it. 
Any dope yet on how he got out?
That man there!
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
Huh?
You mean here in the city?
This puts me in a peculiar hole.
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
Get the cops, somebody.
What's that?
What are you doing here? This is our territory
You wouldn't.
They've got the real thing outside.
Wow!
It was great for me, how was it for you.
A bit too quick.
I don't know?
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Naturally.
Here's to music. And absent friends.
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
And where do you think you're going?
You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
Is it peace in out time?
Yikes.
Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
What about R.J.?
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
He left!
Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
You know... a couple of queers.
What the hell are you laughing about?
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
No, really.
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
No, no I think it's really interesting.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
Yeah.
Keep straight on this road here.
What was that?
Honk at him. Scare him.
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Go around him.
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
Huh?
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
What are you laughing at?
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
You got to be fucking joking.
That's the understatement of the year.
Oh, right.
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.
Oh, you mean on TV.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
Sorry.
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
Hey.
Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
Tell it to my daughter.
Yes, sir.
Aw, fuck.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
It's embarrassing, okay?
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Say my name.
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
When you were a little French girl?
Shall we close up, then?
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
What is wrong, my darling?
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
You were wonderful!
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
Please let me go with you.
You what?
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
Ouch. Yeah?
Always. Ow.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
Loves animals. Loves you.
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
My brother says he likes you, too.
Please, honey, let me in.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
Boy, this is good!
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
Fifteen.
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
Who is it?
Who from work?
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
Good. Making progress.
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
Shit.
Puff, put the gun down.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
Wait!
Boys just passing through?
Yep.
You want a chaser?
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
Huh?
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
And a fact is a fact.
Do we need words?
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
Maybe he knows how to drink.
Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
A thousand.
To do what?
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Where do I sign?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
Sure.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
Fifty per cent?
Aaaahhhh!
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
He's my partner.
In the gut, I mean.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
Eddie...
Get with what?
You don't need a drink.
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
Is this all we got left?
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
With what?
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
What's the limit?
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
So why go to college?
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
I've got something in my bag.
Does it bother you? What he said?
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
A week? A year?
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
He went off someplace.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
Your shot.
Very good shot.
I came to play pool, Fats.
With them?
Need some gas?
Son ... are you awake?
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
Why, Dad?
Are you all right, Dad?
I was so scared.
What happened to you?  Who was that?
I'm home now.
What's wrong, Ellen?
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
He was upset with moving, I believe.
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?
Where, Jimmy?
I swear it was here.
Did you call the State Police?
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
I have school.
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
Love was never our problem.
What's the bad news?
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
Then what?
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
They don't know this.
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
Is my wife in the air?
But what, General?
How do you know?
So, what do you do for a living?
Really? Ballet?
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
I'm not leaving.
What the hell's going on?
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
Why did you people come here?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
All your life.
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
Dad was onto something here!
How's the head?
Yes. Now we know.
The Word of God...
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Yes?
It would make me very happy.
I said go around!
This one. I think he's in here.
Dad!
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
Dad, they come in through the doors.
Rats?
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
Well, uh...
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
What am I looking for?
My lucky charm.
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
And do I detect a rebuke?
Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
Why are you trying to kill us?
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
My name is Kazim.
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
Miss Scott panicked?
We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
Give me the stones!
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
It is why Krishna brought you here.
You don't look very good.
He told me they knew I was coming here.
Took what?
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
What?!
Just one arm!
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
What is it...?
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
Wait -- what're you doing?
I get it!
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
...I need to make a phone call.
Right.
What for?
Kill myself.
You're not crazy.
Why not?
I wouldn't say that.
It can't take that long.
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
Door's locked.
Go out, take your first left.
Which way do I go?
What do you mean?
That's not a good idea.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
Use my credit cards.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
What is it?
It's sand.
What? What do you mean?
Beautiful!
She's...pretty fast.
What do I do?
Don't just stand there, say something.
Where is she staying?
Touch her.
Where are you going?
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
It is my business. It's my name.
You're not just after this girl, are you?
What am I supposed to do?
Some agent you are.
Osaka.
What do I do?
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
Dieter!
I have been... I think you're right.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
I didn't do anything.
What kind of a deal?
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
What Job?
Bit expensive, sir.
I have a new client.
It's just money.
Yes?
What things?
Right.
How do I look?
We're here.
Oh....Sure.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
I will?
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
Yes...What is it?
Nothing.
Nothing.
What do you do about what?
You mean from it.
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
...Naw. Made that up.
Trans Ocean Travel.
Who else is interested in me?
Last night?
No.
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
That I really don't know.
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
It was you.
It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
A drink...
Could I have it, please.
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
Three hours.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
Sure. Where?
P.J.'s.
Monday.
Push it.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
What does that do?
What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
Do you want more rice?
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
How grave?
Yeah?
You're sure you want to do this?
Uh, what are those boxes?
...taping?  What are you taping?
I'm doing an interview.
Where should I wash them?
Thank you, Bob.
Who's calling?
"60 Minutes"?
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
Jeffrey Wigand...
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
Yeah.
...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
Who are these people?
Did I get you up?
Who's that?
I know what I have to know.
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
You charge by the hour?
Why?
Lowell, I can't afford --
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
Where are you, anyway?
What?
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
What are you talking about?
There is -- there is no family.
Right.
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
Object to the form of the question!
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
Is that a threat?
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
You did good, Massey!
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
Who's the pigeon?
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Is that... one person?
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
He's the wrong man.
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
But you don't agree?
Why would you be here?
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
What is it you're after, Miles?
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
Marylin! Listen to me.
So I hear. Is that all?
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
Screw you, asswipe!
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
Me. Yes.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
She held that against you?
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
You don't like me?
I love you. I want to have your baby.
Comfy!
What do you want?
Hello Marylin.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
Income tax evasion?
Who's she?
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
Well what does he want?
Is this Ming?
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
What?!
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
Mr. Rexroth.
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
I don't know. I can assume...
What's Kirshner?
No. You're not.
HA!
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
Wrigley?
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to—
That's an evasion.
Why don't you put me in chains?
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
On the road.
He's marvelous!
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
I'm sorry you read it.
I suppose so.
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I—
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
You've made that quite evident—with all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
No?  Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
What happened to your money?
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New York—and if we didn't go, she might lose it.
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Oh, yeah?
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
I never thought of that.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
That, I suppose, makes everything—uh—quite all right.
Who are you?
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Like this. I have no robe.
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Must be the Spring.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
Yeah?
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
King—King Westley was in it.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Oh, so now I was drunk!
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
Next week "East Lynne."
You didn't give that boy all your money?
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
You're crazy.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride—
Oh, Peter— 
was—but—
But what!
There's no end to your accomplishments.
Eat a carrot.
What'd you give him for the car?
Where's the bus to New York?
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady—
Why, he'll be back.
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the—
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
Get out!
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
Yes?
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Collect?
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that—
Huh?
If it's on the level.
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
I ain't got a hat.
Send it collect.
Who?
Not a minute!
Yeah.
There's a seat over there for you.
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
Yeah—the "big boy"—the Boss of the outfit.
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
Yeah.
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
No, I did not.
You know damn well who it is.
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
You still questioning any Cubans?
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
Please answer the question.
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
No.
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Jim Garrison?
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
And he never hit you before?
I don't know if I should talk about this.
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
She's the best damn witness we have!
I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
That sounds fun.
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
I understand.
How old is that machine gun shit?
Three years.
I found out.
Great, you're here.
What's she want?
What's in it?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
Are you really a bail bondsman?
It's kind of a sports bar
He's the one who wants you.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
It's different with men.
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
Catching a movie.
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
You talk them into it?
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
Right around here, in the food court.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
When did you decide?
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
Which one?
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
He's liable to shoot you.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
What do you tell Nicolet?
If I don't cooperate?
Oh, so now you know him?
You ever see him sell guns?
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
Uh-huh.
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
But you didn't do that.
Where's the bag she gave you?
Kinda.
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
Got some o.j.?
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
The Cockatoo Inn.
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
Plus the same deal as before.
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
I can sit through it once.
Yeah.
C'mon, don't lie.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
He went to meet that stewardess.
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
What's your cost?
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
I know you don't know. I said guess.
Who was Beaumont?
What's your relationship?
Did you get it?
Uh-huh.
Where's the rest of it?
Maybe the Feds got it.
How am I supposed to know that?
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
Haven't a clue.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
She got off, huh?
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
I know where it is.
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
Oh, terrific.
It's hard to explain.
Wait ... Daddy.
Now what?
Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?
You mind? I'm eating, huh?
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
He say what they looked like?
Not me, buddy.
What can I tell you?
What did she have to say?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
Sarah.
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
What? By myself?
I'm walking, aren't I?
I haven't seen her in months.
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
Whataya mean, no record?
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
It's not healthy with it closed.
Go to sleep.
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
What do you mean?
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
The best.
What's in here?
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
Why you left.
Wait. Don't.
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
It's still there, Jake.  Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ...
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
Are you out of your mind?
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Where are they?
Oh God!
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
One drop?
I think I'm falling asleep.
I would have stayed there if I could.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
Clear the area. This is an order!
Call my chiropractor.
Lennox Hospital.
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
I just need to talk.
You in trouble?
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
Goodbye old friend.
We can't lead him into the other hull!
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Sergeant!
What?!
Done!
Boeman, the ships not here.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
What the hell are you doing?
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
I'm with you kid.
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
Kaboom.
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
You lost the charge?
They'll make it.
I'm missing two!
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
Am I in there?
It's just you and me, then.
Kay-em you okay?
Leave him behind!
I'm sending you the files.
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
But...I...400 years?
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
More soldiers?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
My boat's neat, dad!
I know who he is...
It's my charter. My party.
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
Do you see the kids?
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
Home... New York?
You going to be all right?
Only 24 hours!
We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.
I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one...
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
Florida license plate.
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
I've got all these signs here...
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
That's pilot whale, isn't it?
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
20 feet, if it's an inch...
I'll drink to your leg.
Easy! It'll tear right out!
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
Thanks for the message.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
But you copy my work every week.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
I try really hard, actually...
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I don't really know anything about it.
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
Oh, God...
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
What? My eyes are not lying!
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
I know what junk is.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
I actually know this one.
What are you?
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Juno? What's going on?
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
What?!
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
Is this Juno?
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
There are ads? For parents?
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
Aw, please Junebug?
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
Keith's hot.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
What did you do?
What?
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
Like what? Be a rock star?
No.
You lose!
Adele for god sake please lis...
...I said, I like your hair.
You dropped this.
You took this picture?
What's Early been in jail for?
Shush, Adele.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
A book on the warehouse murders?
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Brian I want him out of our car!
Carrie, watch for Early.
Nervous?
Where's Adele?
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...
What is it?
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
...That'd be my guess.
How old you?
Well, how was it?
Oh shit. How long did it take?
Did what take?
Oh man, that's the best.
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
Yeah.
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
Why?
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
You got any money?
Well, those guys share everything, right?
Right.
Right.
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
Why I give pennies?
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
I thought you had a girlfriend.
I'm nervous.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
Do you care about me?
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
Dance!
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Yeah?
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
Mine?
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Whah?
You think so?
You've heard the stories right?
Yep.
No. I was just kidding.
So, how many people live here now?
Slow.
What man? What is it?
Are you crazy?
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
Then let's narrow it down.
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
You're not going to tell me that.
Why her?
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
You sonofabitch!
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
Very good.  How did you know?
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
I know he really likes you.
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
What about prints?
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
Anything else?
Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  They're all the same type.  All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
A building?
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?
No.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Is this your first time here?
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
Do you always open quickly?
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
Of course.
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
No.  You were talking about chess.
You can turn everything around so easily.  This is not just another game, is it?
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
Are you going to come tonight?
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
<u>What</u>?
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Colwyn ...
Where is the Fortress?
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
The Fortress moves?
You choose these?
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
I can. Because I choose it.
You have done it?
It is today?
I ache with it.
Perhaps he expected to eat it.
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
I was hoping I might be your friend.
I don't think you'll grow careless.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
And where do you lead, boy?
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
Would you settle for a boar?
You!
Quell?
I don't think it's working.
Put me down, you lout!
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
Look at its insides.
One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me.
What news from our friends?
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
You were attacked in the forest?
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
I was beautiful then.
We had no children.
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
I cannot stop the sand.
You will come with me.
What's that man's name?
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
It's incredible! How did you do it?
Where are you going?
Risky business, isn't it?
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
...No...
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
...I had a girlfriend... A long time ago.  Before coming here, in my country. I was 14-year-old... We flirted like kids...  Her father didn't want her to meet me.  My family was not very respectable.
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
May I ask you a personal question?
I don't know... Five minutes.
How shall we get out now, Leon?
...Yes?
Don't fear.
Huh, that's good!
...OK... Good.
...Who sent you?
What is it?
Why am I such an authority?
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
I know what you're getting at.
Okay.
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
From where?
Why?
His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
I thought you were asleep.
This story is big huh?
Umm, no.  It's just that --
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
You're walking to California?
I missed you Kris.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
How are you feeling?
What do you mean?
I've always wanted a watch like that.
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
Coffee?
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.
You're pretty drunk.
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
You OK?
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
Can we just forget it?
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
About ready for another drink?
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
A full night on the street and this is all?
Don't hit me.
Harvard Law School?
I can't tell you.
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
I'll take that as a no.
No.
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
No. I was in the shower.
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
Why the hell not?
Was she carrying a weapon?
You can't even imagine.
After you went to all that trouble?
What'd you do?
Is she?
How'd it go at the trial?
Uh -- family.
Relation?
Our group is full.
Really?
You almost had me fooled.
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
What?!
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
No -- it's just -- not me.
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
And I fully support that.
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
You got into Harvard Law?
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
Where?
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
Always.
What do you want with me?
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
What do you want from me?
What will become of me then?
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...
Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
We be honored, friend Ogg.
So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
Pregnant, is she?
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
Worse than the battlefield.
Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
And this?  Some of their handiwork?
My God!  Look!
Something the matter?
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Been telling you that all along, lad.
Will you chance a miss?
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
Will you explain what's going on?
Can't we move any faster?
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
He'll not escape me.
A good day for singing...
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
You promised!
Liar!
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
Unicorn?
Jack!
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
He did run?
Tis the truth.
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
Sunlight?
Everywhere!  Ow!
Honored to make your acquaintance.
Step lively now!
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
As fair as me?
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
Only that?
Wondrously so.
Please...
And as barren of love as stone.
What do we do now?
Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
Up ahead!
How came you by this blade?
Simple as that, eh?
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
In a dream.
I couldn't get it to go down.
You'd better call and cancel.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
He's a freak.
I wanted him to marry her.
I can use your mom's.
We're not gonna do anything.
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
On the handlebars or your shoulders?
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
I don't wanna go.
Where are you?!
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
An exhaust system or a window is code.
I hate to ask about a window.
I have the permit.
How's your wife?
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
Forty.
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
Thank you.
He escaped.  He's going back in.
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
Because I live there.
I'm not going!
You don't have a choice.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
You'll have money when you work.
You can't make me do a thing.
I took some of your Vicodin.
What would you like to be?
Getting high, I guess.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
Sun glasses?
What would you do?
What kind of house?
Good for you.
Thanks for telling me.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
Why does he have a lock on his door?
Where have you been for a week?!
What did you do with your dog?
I need to talk to you.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
It's not breakfast yet.
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
With your hands or your tongue?
Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
That was the truth.
I'm married.
Been thinking?
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
What are you talking about?
His father is a man.
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
After the kids are back in school.
What?
Despite you.
You got a dog?
I guess I could teach you some things.
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
What did you say?
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
But you can't.
No, but...
She's alright, isn't she?
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
Married?
You went to Monroe?
What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
Why didn't you take it?
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
You need collateral.
Reward?
Here I am.
He's dead.
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
You know what I'm saying.
Claude.
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
Well, if that's the way it is...
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right.
If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
I can't take that, mama.
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
Is everyone here?
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
Are you offering me a bribe?
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
Blacks welcome there?
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
He's sick?
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
...their damned souls will be ours.
"Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.
All right. Let me out.
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
How come you're not older?
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
This is bad, Nicky.
So go get 'em, Dad!
Hey.
Bus?
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
You smell like coconuts.
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
Sometimes, sure.
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
What do you mean, "possessed?"
Do me.
No.
What other food?
Had enough?
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
I'm very smart.
Well then...?
Killed? Why do you use that word?
Jessica.
I changed my mind.
I'm listening.
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
I let him go... believe me.
What're you going to do?
I'd rather be with you.
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
Don't!
Don't ever let go.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
Are you sure?
What makes you think so?
Not yet.
Yes...
You're a musician?
Why not?
What is?
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Have you partied with him?
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
How'd it happen, Alice?
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Set.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Are you my man?
What night is that?
You don't look so good.
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Sheila?
Did you tell the police this?
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
Please tell me.
The wife killer?
Have you made any charges against him?
Where's Pete?
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
Did you ask him who he is?
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
No.
That's it.
What's bothering you, Madison?
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
What the hell is going on?!
Where would you feel safe?
I thought there might be somebody inside.
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
Who is this?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
That's ridiculous.
Oh, really?
He might have lost his way.
Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
Yes!
I'm thinking.
What are we going to do?
It's unbelievable.
No.
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Well - I'm—
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
Centuries.
—buy and sell?
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
Please let me help you.
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
Yes.
Why, no.
As far away as I ever want to be.
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
It's astonishing - and incredible, but—
All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
What is it? Has he fainted?
Uh-huh.
Nothing about the porters yet?
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
Maria?
What about the others?
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
What do you suggest?
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
Yes.
I wonder.
I was just going to.
What is it?
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?
Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home.
Why?  What are you gonna do?
I know, but we're on a college campus...
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
Something seem unusual to you about that?
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
You were saying?
They respond to fear, right?
Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
Nowhere.
Er. well, nowhere special.
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
Where's he making his big speech?
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
What?
Take it.
No.  Follow him.
What --
-- but he didn't.
Just some guy... they found.
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
It's all I could safely move.
I can't even stand up --
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
Lara --
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
Uh-huh...
And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
John --
Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
We can't grab it...
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
She spoke to me.
She's a precog?
Stop --
I won!
I wanted to.
The precogs were wrong.
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
The what?
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
You're talking about the precogs...
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
You said they're destroyed.
John?
I thought you were retiring?
Tell him not now.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
I don't understand --
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
Precog Deja Vu...
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
There a maid in this hotel?
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
We could have lunch together.
Raincheck?
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
Nice to meet you, Wally.
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
What's 'incidentals?'
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
He's great, right. Is he great?
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
What's wrong, baby?
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
No coke tonight.  Right?
I'll support you.
There's no touching.
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
Get away from her.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
So what do we do?
Where we going?
Me? No. Not really.
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
Not driving Jess, you won't.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
You told him you liked him.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
Yes.
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
What's that?
Where is the Soho Grand?
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
You don't know where you're going?
What are you saying?
I will.
I think we might.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
C'mon, man...
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
This is bullshit, man.
What did I 'get?'
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
I'm pretty sure we do.
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
Why?
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
Calm down.
It's gonna be fine.
So what do we do?
Let's just go now and wait.
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
What's up, man.
A little.
Yes?
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Yes?
Drinks are free, right?
You strapped?
And where is...?
Yeah.
No. What is it?
Yeah.
What about my keys?
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
How's it feel?
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?
What you talking?
And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
Who the hell are you?
The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
Don't con me.
What for?
Where am I gonna start?
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
I can't.
Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
Why do you ask?
Did you hear what I said?
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
What do you think?
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
Get some sleep.
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
Why don't you just ask your question?
Just what is your question?
I told you we don't know for certain.
If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
"His greatest greatness."
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --
Your control over your children, therefore --
What mission?
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
So what about him?
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
Might be all right.
I'm the man.
Only a pig could do a thing like that.
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
I don't know shit about you.
[Why?]
I show, you give me the information?
[What is his name?]
[No!]
[What money?]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[Where do I find him?]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[Who's he?]
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[I want you.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[Maybe your men stole from you.]
And what if amateurs try it?
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
So what's wrong?
What are you doing here?
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
Pinta...
Yes or no?
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
Time will tell.
We're taking a different way home.
And don't start crying.
Do you think he'll come back?
How do you think he got out?
They'll be back in a week.
Did you sleep alright?
You feel sorry for the husband?
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
Your father has business.
Could I stop you?
You don't drink like you used to.
That's not a question.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Still not a question.
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
You've done much of this work before?
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
Creasy... Wait.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
[Is that good or bad?]
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
He's not a cop killer.
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
What?
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
I'll call her up.
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
Waddaya getting so sore about?
Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?
I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
When was this?
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
Why don't you just move out to Portchester?
Oh, I'm fine.
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
I'd like that very much.
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
We just live one flight up.
You say something?
Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
That's the one.
...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy."
What time is it?
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Oh, we got plenny-a room here.
You gonna get married.
Marty...
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses...
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
Hello, Thomas.
He coming home right now.
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
That's all right, that's all right...
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...
We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
Never this close.
Stop him! Stop that man!
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
Look at the size of those two beasts.
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
People will talk.
We think the same way.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
Radar!
C-A-M-E-M...?
Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
For you, Trapper.
It's in pretty deep.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
The bastards outconned us.
See you.
You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
Our minds?
Something else we have in common.
Very happily married.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
You're on his side all of the sudden?
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
The one and only.
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
What's wrong with you?
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Sir?
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Oh, get out of here!
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
Nice.
Did you get it, too?
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it?
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
No.
Oh. Yeah.
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going—
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
How much money do you get?
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. Well—I don't quite know what to say . . .
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
The Websters!
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
John Doe.
What John Doe?
A deal?
Plus a bonus.
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Okay, fellows.
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulled—the Governor's starting a libel suit—what's more, they all know John Doe's a phoney—and they insist on seeing him.
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
I ain't seen him for a week.
The heelots!
Well, anyway, I—I guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
Hello, Mr. Connell.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
That's a lie! Listen—don't believe what he says . . .
Yes! I was paid! But the—
What difference does that make?
Flowers.
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
Uh-huh.
Say, who's putting up this dough?
You're my hero.
Dinner's on you.
What happened? Is there a problem?
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
Anything on Korda so far?
Being faxed over now.
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
How did you like Toronto?
Do you really?
Where did you hear that?
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
Yes.
I'm just practicing my lying.
They need to run first and second?
He's cutting down the visibility.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
That's a chance I gotta take.
Have you evacuated anyone?
Is the hostage injured?
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
Yeah?
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
Your concern is heartwarming.
You let us worry about that.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
How come I can't remember?
Your life that bad?
No.
Only up there in the dream they called life.
You sure he's going to come?
It's his nature.
Take care.
What?
The truth.
Insurance.
Cleaning up a mess.
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
That's not possible.  No one can do that.
Don't know what you're talking about.
What's so funny?
There?
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
Is this... food!
Yeah, right.
Wow.  Sand.
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!
Where did it originate?
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT!
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
And how do we do that?
I'm outta here.
What is THAT!
NINJA APE ZORD!
You've got the public upset, Al.
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
I remember reading a poem in college. "Sicily. Poor, noble isle...".
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
I got my partner in there!
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
He was around...
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
You got men on Profaci's place?
Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer.
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
Inside, they were talking of you.
Same here.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
You fellas got names?
Meyer.
Like a party for all our friends.
Who?
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Not stupid. Fat.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
I don't fuck my partners.
They do what I tell 'em.
We must be friends, Charlie.
Masseria's been after me too.
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
Luciano is dead?
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Anything!
You're fuckin' crazy.
Special occasion?
What?
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Holy shit.
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
Monkeybone...!?
You sure this is...medically advisable?
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
Can't you give it to me later?
Who?
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Stu...Stu...
What's wrong?
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
Where to?
You mean it's dangerous?
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Thanks very much, sonny--
Never.
What's he bringing pigeons for?
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
Huh?
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
I'm still asking myself--what is he-- animal, vegetable, or mineral? A Senator! A United States Senator! I thought I'd seen everything but-- why, he doesn't know what time it is, Diz! When I think of myself sitting around--playing straight for all that phoney, patriotic chatter-- *me*, carrying bibs for an infant with little flags in his fists--no, I can't take it, Diz--I'm through--I quit!
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
*All right*, then. After all, what's it to me? So they *drop* him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through.
Any time.
Tonight?
I'll cherish ya.
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
No.
Well, let's get going.
What?
You know, we're getting married.
He's a house-afire!
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
Dinner, Hubert.
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
Emma! I'm a man at the end of his rope.
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
Henry Hill.
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
The--head?
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
Jeff for Senator.
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
Thank you, sir.
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
Goodnight, Jeff.
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
Mr. President--
Will the Senator--
Mr. President--
Now, now, now--that isn't going to get you any place. Get a firm grip, Ma!
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
*No*!
The man downstairs said number--
Convene?
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
How?
What's that?
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
No complaints.
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Why?
I've got more. You better tell me.
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
What do they--? Who are all those--?
Already? All these letters?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
Do you want to dictate them?
What you *have* to do is fight!
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
You were about to recognize me, sir--
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Go away, Nosey.
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
He's lost complete faith in me--
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
Yes!
Are these the articles?
That's all, Miss Bennett.
Look, this is my house. I'd like to—
Feel better now?
What did they say?
Yes.
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
I'm from a small town too, you know.
He played in the town band, too.
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
In a day or so, I think.
What's the matter, hon?
No. It's nothing.
You're a fool, Babe.
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
With pay!  She is out the door.
Yes.
Come on, come on!
John—
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is—
Gold, eh?
Oh, yes sir.
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Sit over there, will you?
Come on, John. What happened?
Must we have the echo?
Your Honor, I object.
It's a lie!
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
Hang up.
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney—
Yes?
How do you do.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Have a drink?
What're you talking about?
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Me?!
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
No.
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Uh-huh.
Binge?
Is she home?
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
Yes, sir.
You're Walter, aren't you?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Prairie? Oysters?
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
But she's on the telephone—
What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
Uh-huh. What are they?
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Ernest, what do you think?
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
Doc. Nice to meet you.
I've had my moments.
Althea hasn't told you?
A little.
What do you think's wrong with her?
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
Yeah.
My patient had to leave early.
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Okay.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
But you know how to drive?
You're good.
We're going for a walk.
Oh... not a real doctor.
I think you do.
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
It's all right.
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
That's what I like.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
I guess you saw the show...?
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
You feel violated?
It's called pro bono.
What happened today?
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
Nah... scotch.
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
Well, there's Lily.
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
Really?
Sounds like you have several.
It wasn't the best situation.
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
Psych major?
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
Really?
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
You know where he's taking her?
Now go find me a big stick.
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
No?
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
What did you find? What did you see?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
Is he supposed to look like that?
It's everybody's problem!
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
But he's just a filthy criminal?
Tough break.
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
I know you did.
I thought you were done?
Snap out of it!
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
Are you with me... or against me?
You're dead.
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Hi.
Or talk?
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
You drink too much.
What are you talking about?
I can't.
The who?
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
So where's the art?
Here you go. 
Or Batman --
The who?
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
That was too close.
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
Ah -- you approve?
I think it's absolutely charming.
What forces do you have at your disposal?
Where are they?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
And where is Joseph?
Was the trip normal in every respect?
Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
Bastia -- and you?
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
Ah-hh, no.
Why didn't you wake me then?
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
No, sir.
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
I know of no better time.
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
Well, you shall see.
Ah, that is good.
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
Were you in love with him?
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Promise me.
I don't understand you.
Promises mean nothing.
Five minutes.
Yes!!
There's probably some explanation.
He's downstairs -- somewhere.
Yes, I wrote it.
I couldn't face telling you.
You mean you heard them making love?
Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
And, where did you see my portrait?
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
What did you say his name was?
Come in.
That's it?
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
Well, let me in.
Stretch it out.
What you mean talk to her?
Fuck, what's his name?
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
What?
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
What you mean, so?
I hope to God that dog is happy.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
You sure you don't wanna stay?
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
What is it?
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
Where's Craig?
Get on.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
I...
I appreciate that.
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
That's...a comfort to hear.
What?
And your husband works for somebody else.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
This? I've never even fired one.
What would you do in my place?
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
Again.
I don't know.
But...
No. Kisses to you.
It's a twenty.
Please. Something is going to happen...
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
Keep the change.
Well?
I don't know.
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
I'm not a baby.
It's under control.
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
I'm looking for them.
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
She went.
And the Lord told that man --
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
What's wrong, Mother?
Just went?
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
Amen! Amen!
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
I tried to save her.
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
You swore, Pearl!
Pearl! You ain't --
She's gone to Moundsville.
Are we goin' home, John?
Huh?
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
What?
Now it's your turn.
What secret shall I tell?
How old are you?
What's your name?
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
John's bad.
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
I was praying.
No, Harry! I thought --
I -- no, I --
Mornin', ladies.
Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
Them kids is yours?
The Drugstore?
What you been up to?
He never asked me for nothin'.
Miz Cooper!
How can you tell?
Jesus, it's dark in here.
What happens if they don't do that?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
Who? Who did that?
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
You okay?
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
I must be going nuts...
Give me the key, mother.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
Rod says the sweetest things.
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
About what?
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
Evening gown?
A dress you wear in the evening.
Just for the honeymoon.
Are we free, Buljanoff?
Or it might be the firing squad!
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
What time have you, Gaston?
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crème de Bretagne... 
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
And if we have to go to Siberia...
Yes, monsieur?
What's new?
Allow me, Comrade.
Yes, Comrade.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
So that is your house?
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
Is this what you call the "butler"?
He takes good care of that.
Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
That is correct.
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
You know I want to...
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
Must one always be after something?
Because we are an odd couple.
Then you should go back to your table.
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
Ninotchka, I love you.
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
How do you do?
All right, we'll make it red.
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
Is this the wish of the masses?
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
Yes, sweetheart. 
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
Hello, Leon!
Did you win?
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
What did he say?
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
You can't imagine.
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Am I interrupting?
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
Hello, Leon darling!
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
Go on.
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
Yes.
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
Cigarette?
I don't understand.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
Is it?
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
Pay him.
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
No, sir.
I thought the gloves were off.
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
Sorry ...
May I say something, Mr. President?
There's no secrets here, Al.
June twenty-third, '72, sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI.
It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
That's right ...
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.
How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
All right.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
Money.  Follow the money.
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
What about happiness, Mother?
What ... ?
Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it?  I want to go home, Dick.  Time to go home.
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
Are you tapping Kissinger?
This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
Thank you for coming, Dick.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
I always get my man.
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
Did you cry when he died?
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
How many?
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
We got the press this time!
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
You're not a failure, Dick.
Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech?
It's over, Dick.
Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
It'll be over soon.
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
Won or lost?
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
Who else'd be in your truck.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
Try "old" on for size.
None of that explains your man though.
Would you tell me if you had?
Some pretty bad people.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
Yes ma'am, I do.
But you don't believe it.
Believe you're right.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
How's that, Sheriff?
Maybe I'll go ridin.
Okay.
I can't plan your day.
No.
I wouldn't worry about it.
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
What's in the satchel?
Llewelyn.
Yeah.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
What's that.
I don't need to talk to you.
Yeah? Where am I?
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
No. Do you?
...For instance. I used birshot. So as not to blow the window.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
Didn't mean nothin'.
Will there be anything else?
You already asked me that.
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
No.
The kind with the most poles.
Okay.
I want you to take me to another motel.
You tell me the option.
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
You want to change rooms?
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
How would you describe him?
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
Why would he go to Odessa?
The heroin. You don't have it.
No I don't have it.
Yes sir. Two tours.
How is she?
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
Bad idea...
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
Well, do something, then, damnit!
Little place called "Williams," why?
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
Oh. How come?
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
"Thirty-two?"
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
Why do they keep calling you George?
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
Why are you doing this to me?
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
Really?
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
I'll go to the Hospital.
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
He has a wife?!
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Why'd you help me in the first place?
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Where are you going?
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
Could you give us an example?
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
I... I don't know...
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
I didn't. You gave me a look!
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
Should I kill him now?
I hope you're right...
So what the fuck's a Finn?
I know that.
That was a really shitty thing to do.
Where? Where is she?
I'm not telling.
So you believed the bartender. Why?
What doesn't?
Wesley...
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
What did you say?
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
You lie, motherfucker...
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
- and share one of your graves.
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
...Pete?
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
Gopher, Everett?
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
Uh, we uh-
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Them straw polls is ugly.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Devil his due.
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
- in the gods - Huh?
You -
Uh-huh.
YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
Don't I know it.
So I borrowed it till I did know!
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
But...
Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil!
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!
...Yeah?
It's bona fide!
She's at the five and dime.
I been calling for four months.
Thank you, sir!
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
Good morning, girls.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
Zack, we've got to go.
Joe!
Esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
No, sir!
Pity you don't have the character.
Yes, sir!
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
See you in the fleet, sir!
What did you call me, boy?
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
No, sir!
Where are you from, boy?
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
Yes I do!
Is your brother a flyer?
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
I'm a little late, that's all.
How late?
Everything was different.
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
You hope.
You serious about having him over?
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
Lynette, where's Sid?
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
Why?
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
Jets.
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
Thanks for covering for me.
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
You're welcome.
What if she called the cops?
Bullshit.
They're not supposed to be here!
They're coughing.
She's never coming out.
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
Yeah, whatever.
Huh?
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.
That's highly inappropriate.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
Yeah.
Shaky?
Nope.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Small space?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Got him!
We're never getting out of here.
Stop it.
What if I spazz out?
Where is the Glucogen?
Uhh... I with it sister but...
Tyrone...
No...
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
Get out of the car.
What are you crazy?
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
One: "We want freedom. We want the power to determine the destiny of our Black Community." Two: "We want full employment for our people." Three: "We want to end the robbery by the white man of our Black Community." Christ, they're asking for reparations...
Jesus...
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy?
Alone...
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
Wait a second there brother...
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
What's the pig's name?
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
Huh?
If you got something to say, say it.
Fuck is up?!
Motherfuckers...
Rose, what the hell you doing here?
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
You believe that?
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
You couldn't have known.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
Colonel will do.
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
Oh?
That one is a bit more difficult.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
How can we end this madness?
Father...
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
Where?
If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course.
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
Your son, what did you name him?
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
That bad?
Put those away.
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
Bite?
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
But don't you dare say that.
I'm sure you're not.
Not at all.
You folks ready to go on?
I can hardly read these.
Does she love the cat?
Can I have another one?
Rachel not feeling well?
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
I just said--
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
What's in your head, boy?
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
I'll torture it out of you.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
Now?
Do you believe him?
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
I'm glad we got here in time.
Come on!
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
How did you get off the island?
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
You threatened Miss Swann.
Who makes all these?
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
Where does it make berth?
Agreed.
We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
'Bootstrap?'
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
Wait -- what about the pistol?
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
... no.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
Poppy, please --
Facts, Dr. Nebbleman.  Facts. You've been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment, haven't you?
That might work.
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?
Aaabout...?
The replicators?
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Is that what Argon told you?
You're afraid of him.
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
When did you...?
Somebody has to.
Same old Daniel.
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
Mouse?  What mouse?
Daniel!
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
Susan!
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
I feel very emotional right now.  A bit out of control.
How far can you stretch?
I could go with you.
That's going to fit me?
Did you go?
Argon's private lab.
Susie... I...
I remember I was trying to help...
Icky!
Exactly.
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
Where did you get those letters?
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me—
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
Do you like them?
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
No? What do you look upon her as?
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
I poisoned him.
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher—
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
Mother!
Yale '21, I believe.
Is that so?
Yeah!
Thank you very much.
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
Yeah.
With me you can always do business.
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
No?
No!
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
You're my what?
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
Quite so. Quite.
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
The boss is getting hoarse.
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
How is her family going to feel about it?
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
There you are—!
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
To Old Madrid.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Right.
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
What did he want?
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
No.
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
I think you'd better go.
Holy jumping swordfish!
I suppose you know why I came—?
Now don't be absurd, Smith—  May I come in?
Surely, come right in.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
Nobody seems to want to do anything—  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
No, sir!
Well, sir, I putter.
I just putter.
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
Oh, hi ...
Like a drum.
Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
Oh, gosh no.
It's better, Mary Sue.
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
I think I've got something to say.
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
What do you mean!?
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
Oh God.
I still don't see why we're doing this.
We're supposed to be in school.
Can we do any better?
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
Not directly anyhow ...
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
Yes.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
That was sure swell ...
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Yeah.
I like calling you David.
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
Yeah ...
Re-runs?
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
There's worse places.
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
What's wrong?
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
Hey.
So you can't talk to me?
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
This is "Fly With Us?"
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
Hello.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
You're so scared.
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
No she didn't; that's a lie.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
Do you like porno movies?
...yeah....well you have me now.
You sound very cute, very nice.
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
Hi....what....what's up....?
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
Yes.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
I know I did. But I don't.
I don't know.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
I saw a picture of you.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
Really?
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Is everything ok?
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
Really?
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
...what...?
This is funny.
Are you ok?
I'm sorry.
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Ok.
You're hand is bleeding.
Your hand is bleeding.
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
What?
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
How many sisters do you have?
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
You ok?
Why you wearin' a suit?
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
Hi, Lance.
Is this where you live?
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
Are you serious with this?
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
What are you doing?
Ok.
When can you leave?
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
Hello?
I'll go pay for my car.
It's not bad, it's ok.
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
I'm sorry. You're right.
I'll just see you when you get back here.
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels?
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
Why not?
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
If you only mean to dupe me again --
What the devil --
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
An innocent child is dead.
Don't confuse one organ with another --
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
Do you favor its publication?
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
Poorly.
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
Is it terribly erotic?
It's a long story, this one.
"...your wife."
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
I am not a wealthy woman.
This is neither the time nor the place --
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
Uh-huh
Who are you, sir?
The actor
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
It's not really--
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
Marion--
There's nothing to explain
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
You are repellant when you drink.
How so?
Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
Sir, I-
"Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me."
We're using-
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
What are movies about?
Who the hell's Manolete?
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
Let me out.
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
Hey, kid. Gregg.
Christ.
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
Is that from one of the Gospels?
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
It came.
You're lying to me.
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
This is an abomination There's no music and--
No, we're jake. But listen-
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
How can he embarrass you?
What who's been sayin'?
You're a good sport, lady.
Where's your wife, Jake?
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
Sure. What is it?
Hit me in the face.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Who's that?
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
Yeah, she's nice.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
Say what you're gonna say.
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
C'mon, Joey.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
What time is it?
Three more, I figure.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
Can you see it?
Who asked you?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
Where you been all day?
I am answering...
Then what?
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
All right, I'll try. See you later.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
Excuse me for living.
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
Jeff -- huh?
A detective's nightmare.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
This is Doyle, Jeff.
I told you that --
Like what?
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
Congratulations, Jeff.
For what?
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
I'll send you some comic books.
Gunnison?
I can't. The police have it by now.
That's normal.
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
No.
Mrs. Doyle?
Yes.
It is something really important, Jeff?
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
What would you think of starting off with dinner at the "21"?
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.
Tell me about it.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
What do you think?
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
To get on home.
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
From his landlord -- once a month.
Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
L. B. Jefferies.
Jim Stark.
I think I should go home.
What time is it?
You can't protect me.
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
Except yourself!
Is he there?
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
Jim.  What's yours?
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
Who's that!
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
Can I keep it?
Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
They like you.  Okay?
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Leave me alone.
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
Bully for you.
Who lives?
Won't mother be proud.
You going there?
Yeah--why--
Dig the square wardrobe!
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
You cold?
Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
Why?
You disappointed?
I never felt so clean before.
Plato, where's your father now?
I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
Do you think your father means that?
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
No.  Why?
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
Good evening.
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
Toys for... adults?
No, no --
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
Do that again.
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Ashley, Jesus --
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
Nick --
No, Nick, no --
Gabriel!
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Don't say my name...
I don't know...
I'm almost done.
How are we gonna do this, Nick?
You... you... YOU --
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
No --
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
You said it a million times!
Put him in the truck.
You're not Nick Mason...
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
She says a lot of things.
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
Christmas... Eve...
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
You got one hour.
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
Six men means six guns.
Ash?
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
Mr. Bangs.
What?
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
Ain't there yet.
I'm just saying.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
Jesus, Rudy --
Do what?
Start talkin
Daddy, did ya see that?
I don't know, but somebody did.
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
But what is this?
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
Sure.
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
What's the cut, poppa?
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
So, talk.
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
It's not good...
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.
You really think we were set up?
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
I got 'em, all right?
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
So what is it?
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
Not these guys.
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
Tell them to come on in.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
Anybody hurt?
Yes, ma'am.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
Where do you keep the can opener?
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
I'll make the soap myself.
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
So did I. They were in it.
I -- lost something.
I can't --
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
You're not bein' quite fair.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Suppose I take a look.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
Clay Phillips.
What for?
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
Would they be good to eat?
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
Goodnight.
That's always tough. How long were you together?
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
I found a picture of his wife.
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Ouch!!
Hey, you left your book back there.
Yeah.
Feel that?
Better try a little higher.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Listen to me I --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Okay, I get the point.
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
My child, you're alive!
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
What are you getting at, Professor?
I take it you're not mad at me.
I finished all the interviews.
Let me see the files.
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
In about fifteen minutes.
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
The image there.
Are you sure it's not the tape?
Hello Dwight.
What are you working on?
That's right.
My help?
You're not wearing a belt.
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Father, are you okay?
Yes.
Because she will lie?
Yo son, check this out.
This part removes the sense of humor.
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
I saw blood! And it's brown! Not red like in horror movies, but brown!!
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
But Mom, the video's not over.
I'm so happy I could shit.
You've been working in that video shop too long.
She's gonna kill Scotty!
I love that you're my wife.
You bring me such peace...
You bitch!
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
I certainly was not!
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
Marvin A. Pickles.
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
I do, please.
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
Yes... but... I didn't...
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
What was that?
I'll give you fifty cents.
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
You can?
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse ——  -- used a phony health inspector's badge —— they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
You could go and open the door.
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
I'll give you a check.
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
She's a pretty good sort.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
 What have you done about Irving August?
Oh, I'm making investigations.
I don't know.
Why wait?
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
But it's a small room, Jason.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
I have to go —-
And Gregory -- he loves her.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
What was she to you?
And this poetry —— like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
One believes -— it's like any other religion...
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
I didn't know.
But she was here?
Yes?
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
No, not really.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
I don't know.
What's the first?
Would you mind?
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
Nothing I can't finish later.
Donna?
What... what are these interviews about?
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
This is just... so...
What will you do when the money runs out?
Tell me your name.
Do you talk to him?
Is he going to see this?
I fantasized about you.
Have you fantasized about me?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
You said you weren't always impotent.
That's correct.
Yes.
Her name was Elizabeth.
How come?
I'm not in love with you.
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
But that was part of it?
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
Graham...
Mmmmm...
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
Who'd you have lunch with?
Something wrong?
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
What?
Why?
You son of a bitch!!
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
No, I haven't.
I guess.
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
What's wrong with that?
Will you stop? Jesus.
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
Why not?
Apparently.
Yes, I did.
Cynthia!
I can't believe you did that!!
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
I don't want to discuss it.
It's a sun dress.
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
Why don't you let me tape you?
Do I sit or stand?
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
Your first sexual experience.
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
Then what happened?
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
Maybe.
Cynthia. John.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
Nothing wrong with trying.
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
You told Ann about this?
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
I know. Will you please leave now?
It'll just be me.
I like having the car, the car is important.
So is my wife, asshole!!
What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
Hi. Want a drink?
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
Kiss, kiss?
OK. But late.
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
Huh?
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
Infantile regression.
Introduce yourselves.
When do I get to see Brad?
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.
That's us.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
Mental instability?
Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
Brad!  Oh, Brad.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
I'm sorry, Officer.
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
YOUNG BLOOD
BRAD!
F for...
This could be worse than the old series.
She walks in beauty...
The fuck was that?
It's Christine.  Hey you.
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
So I guess that's it.
What are you pouring tonight?
How's it hanging, Miles?
Hey, guys. How's it going?
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Oh, that's tasty.
What?
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
Huh.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
So what's the plan today?
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
We're on.
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
So what should I wear?
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Where is Stephanie?
What the fuck are you doing?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
Could be anything.
Shut up.
With Maya.
What's happening?
Do you like them?
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
What's up?
That's five clicks, Jackson.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
No, I'm okay.
Look at this!
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
So what gems do you have in your collection?
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
Yeah, weird. But great.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
Got it.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
I had class.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Oh, Maya. No.
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Ken.
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
So what are you up to today, Miles?
Stephanie! Stop!
Only for pee or poop.
This one?
Just make noises then.
This guy got on the roof in like a second.
That roof is over ten feet high.
Yes.
They're distracting us?
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
I'm getting out now.
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
The footprints.
Second thing this week I can't explain.
Okay.  So he was tall?
I don't think so.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
You're not Baxter?
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
I understand.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.
What now?
You wanted to see me?
What's all this then?
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
The jury saw it differently.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
He was murdered.
What's stopping you?
Why would they stop you?
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
I heard that too.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
What's she got to do with it?
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
Stella.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
You really are a gambler.
Where's the dog now?
What makes you say that?
How about you?
I don't want you to get hurt.
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
Almost right.
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
What about it?
There isn't one.
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.
-- I can explain.
The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
She said you were very beautiful.
Do what?
As a matter-of-fact I am.
Impossible.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Hello?
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
You look so, so...
Simone?
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
It was more in passing.
Hal, what are you doing?
How did the wall get there?
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
I know plenty of boys.
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
Nice boat, Taransky.
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
I don't understand.
You're in breach.
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
Simone, are you there?
Good morning, Simone.
Maybe he can.
I am the death of real.
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
You know what I'm talking about.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
You use needles?
Dr. Crowe.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
No.
How often do you see them?
Cats?
What do you want more than anything?
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
They're right here.
You can see her?
What are you thinking, Momma?
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
Superstition.
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Gene.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
Should we be doing this, dude?
"With a hack-hack here --"
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
You got something against farm people, Keith?
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Chicken sandwich?
Shit!
Yeah. That's just the problem.
Yeah?
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
Suzie... No.
Listen to me --
Where's Mac?
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Looks like a chipmunk.
Yeah.
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
All the rib eyes?
Welcome home.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
A what?
Driving?
I give up.
Hey...
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
Let's hit it.
What kind of a guy is he?
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Save it. We got a long haul.
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
I'm at marker eight-five.
You okay?
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Anything on the Swede?
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
Did he give you his name?
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
...I forgive you Darwin.
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
What happened?
His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
I left him a message.
Without peer?
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
-- he's doing it then, huh --
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
A million flat.
Yeah... Sid?
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
You love her?
A Fed? Like FBI?
You'll end up like me.
I want to hear your version.
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
Her oxygen would have run out.
But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
Why?
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
Where've you been?
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
Who have you been talking to?
Can you sleep?
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
It's all right.
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
Am I really her?
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape.
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
Looks a little constipated to me.
Are you nervous?
I'll come with you.
So it was "love".
You don't like him, do you?
Open the door, will you?
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
How long you going away for?
"For"...?
I don't know...
Not if you don't want me to.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
Nothing.
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
Get in bed.
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
I think -- she's crazy.
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
What?
What was that?
I'm sorry.
What did you do tonight?
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
Wasn't your fault.
Does it make you... hard?
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
Under the table.
Lay back, Mack.
Shooting?
I don't think she can sing, either.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
Jesus Christ.
How are you doing, kid?
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Can't focus...
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
Huh?
I-- uh--
Uh is a good start.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
Some prep school thing.
What are you doing this weekend?
What's your problem?
Well, no.
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
I am old enough to--
I'm a photographer, remember?
The record--
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Peter, what can I do for you?
I don't think I'll be running into him.
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
No…
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
Is you all little Adolfs?
Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
Brother, were we all wet about you!
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
Not you.
It's on me.
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
I'll live.
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
You starting that again?
What's the decoy?
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
You heard him.
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
What happened to you?
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
Left behind?
Where is he now?
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
Antonia?
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
No, I didn't know that.
Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
Nothing for me.  I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
The thought had crossed my mind.
The royal...studs?
Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
Mr. Chekov -- ?
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
Mr. Scott?
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
Good shooting, Scotty.
What happened...?
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
Count on our help, sir.
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
... A cloaking device?
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Wait! Give me a chance --
But, why?
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
... Yes...
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
Yes... But -- how...?
What about Spock?
Success, my lord.
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
How can you tell that?
They outnumber us, my Lord --
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
How is that...?
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
That's all you have to say?
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
... Can't read you... repeat...
Maybe...
You're crazy -- !
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
I'm Admiral Kirk...
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
I didn't expect anything.
Steady on course. All systems normal.
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
Let them eat static.
They won't --
Departing dark side, Regula.
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
Try the emergency channels...
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Admiral --
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
And who is this?
I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot‚g‚'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
Will you accompany me to the bridge?
How far?
It literally is Genesis...
What's she doing here?
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
... No, sir. It has not.
Khan!
On screen...
<u>WHAT</u>?
Time from my mark...
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Time!
Stop engines.
Sir, you did it.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
He's very human.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
To Earth. To offer testimony.
You do this -- for friendship?
I do this because I was there,
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
Heard there was some excitement.
You sure this is such a bright idea?
We've done it before.
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
We're just -- observing.
No, <u>my</u> name.
Go ahead. Stun me.
Ah, well done, team 2.
So you were at Berkeley.
Memory problems, too.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
Thanks. Cheers.
Where could you take them?
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
So. There we are.
Kirk. They're gone.
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
Why does it have to be goodbye?
Thank you, Admiral.
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
Come on, fellah -- speak up!
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
What is it?
Uhura!... Where!
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Humpbacked - people.?
Admiral! There be whales here!
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
I'll have to re-energize.
The explosive override -- ?
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
It is kind of you to make this effort.
Deceive us?
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
Jak'tahla?
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
I understand.
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
Sometimes I do.
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
Incomplete, I might add.
I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
You're not going to launch anything until...
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation.  This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
I don't believe it happened that way.
... had regenerated.
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
That's your expert opinion?
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
No, sir. It is a gorch.
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
How long has he been unconscious?
I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
Isn't it better like this...?
I have helm control.
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
Did you know her?
Juice?
I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
Entering the upper ionospere...
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Where in the States?
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
"Money." So you can get dome money...
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
What?
It can't wait until tomorrow...
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
What the hell is happening, Worf?
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
Admiral Donald...Bill...
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
Spock, that was actually funny.
Can you - ?
Figures.
Damned clever if you ask me...
They'll respect him now...
My God, what happened here?
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
You were demoted...
Yes.
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
Shields. Battle stations.
Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...
Aye, sir.
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
I've heard of chameloids - "Shapeshifters" - I thought you were mythical.
Captain, if --
As you were. Lieutenant...?
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
Surely not.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
I was asked by my father to open neg-
I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
They're dying.
I am uncertain.
I SHOULD have been -
Uhura?
Not as yet, sir.
We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
- could take weeks, sir.
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Brother. I cannot move.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
No.
How long does he have?
And this makes you "sad"?
Now, you make a toast.
To new worlds...
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
Data!
It'll only work for one of us.
How can you be sure?
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
No.
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
Counselor.
Do you have a moment, sir?
You're speaking of emotional investment?
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
Open a channel.
It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
We're being hailed.
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
Report.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
What happened?
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
Were we always explorers?
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
Why am I here?
What are you doing?
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
Why are you here?
You know that's not possible.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
Intruder alert!
Are we prepared?
No -- this is wasting time.
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
I understand.
No.
What do you think of America?
No!!! No!!!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
Contain it and get back to me.
When can we expect containment?
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
What?
I won't let anyone hurt you.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Ah... no...
Gear shift.
What?
Money.
Minneapolis... good.
A drink.
I want to try it.
What's the matter?
Then let me go. You don't need me.
Yes.
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Jennyhaydn.
I like this music.
That was beautiful.
You liked my singing?
No. Get in.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
I don't want you to be hurt.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
What?
Good morning.
Yes, they are.
May I have twenty-five cents, please?
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
I understand.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
Help me!!!
Is it for real?
This has always been my favorite time of day.
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
Forget it's there.
Tonight.
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
What's going on?
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
You think Tran killed her?
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
Let's work it.
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
Looks like she was holding out.
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Charm.
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
Yeah, but that was for love.
What the fuck are you doing?
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
What's that?  Present from Faith?
Black.  Jack.
And gives it to you.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
Is this great fabric or what?
So that gives you something.
And what about the guy that was following me?
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
I've got a good idea, yeah.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
It was a tough call.
Who's Strickland?
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
I guess.
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
Maybe cause he's smart.
We have another one.
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
How do you feel, Agent
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
"Was?"
I didn't use Low's name.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
Not especially.
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
Doesn't fit.
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
Find the feet?
And nobody else can do that?
Hello?
Tom, you okay?
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
How did you know Speck was a killer?
Yes, sir.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
Is he dead?
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
Shit.
You're right. I know.
Ever since I've known you.
You should call your Grandmother.
Are you sure? Maybe...
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
Yes. Like the quiche.
Why? You're not a real man?
Just like that?
You too?
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
Like what?
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
...not until you book it...
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
You haven't told then, huh?
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
The poor thing. Six years?
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
What do you guys do?
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Well... This is it.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
It's not going to well?
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
...The red piece of shit over there...
...well, it suits you...
Yeah?
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
It's definitely a step back for me.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
I do. Good for you, man.
An eight.
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
Ah, there's the rub...
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
You haven't been drinking, have you?
What's dumb about it?
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
What are you talking about? Vegas?
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
You gotta do it.
Thanks for clarifying that.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
She smiled, baby.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
She was hot.
Don't remind me.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
No.
What time's this party tonight?
You looked right at her, baby.
She didn't see.
...against the computer.
No.
You think?
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
...shivering...
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
It is on.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
...Okay, two...
Good.  He never doubted you.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
Godfather.
Yeah.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
Outside.
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
When did he call?
What is this nonsense?
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
Yes.
What was this for?
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
You want him to stay in this country.
Godfather, you understand everything.
Corleone.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
Beautiful all over, eh?
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
What was that?
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
You know I love spaghetti.
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
What time do they expect us?
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?
A million times.
Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
Just be patient.
You straightened my brother out?
Yeah.
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
It's vile.
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
Shut up.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
What? What's this?
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
What?
This is so good of you.
I played piano in a few places.
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
Why?
I wanted to tell you my plan.
How?
I love Marge.
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
What evening?
What are you doing?
Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?  I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
Where's Mr MacCarron?
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
I never said that!
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
What about Cortina?
He hates being confronted.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
Very.
I found Dickie's rings.
It's all true.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
How would you know that?
We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
As in the...?
Randall.
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! 
A ragione. A ragione. 
No.
Tell him I have a fiancée, Dickie has a fiancée and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
He's already angry, I don't think --
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
I'm fine.
It's okay.
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Peter, I... I...
November 7th is my information.
A few days ago.
It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.
That's an expensive gun.
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
You must be rich.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
But this is a porno movie.
I'm leaving.
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
Keep it.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
That's fine.
You said that?
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
20 bucks?
Well... I guess so.
What's your real name?
No.
Do they drug you?
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
That's not hard to do.
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
What should I do? Call the cops?
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
What do you mean?
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
Why do you ask?
Why?
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
I'm here to see Iris.
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
Well, I just, you know...
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
I know.
Mason.  Mason?
You knew?  All this time?
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
Me too.
I do?
You first.
It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
Whoa.
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
Nine hundred...
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
Delly, shhhhhh...
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
Only one in town.  Get in, son.
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
A super market.  Huh.
When did I leave?
Mother.  She's beautiful.
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
Ernie.
Well...
Dad, I...
... what?
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
What is it?
I... I don't believe this.
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
Yeah, well, that's enough.
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
When was that?
That was beautiful.
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
My girlfriend.  If she still is...
Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist?
Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
San Francisco.
What do you mean?
A trifle.
Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
Do you think I should go?
That's up to you.
Mom, they're in a cage!
Miss Daniels?
Right across the bay there.
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
I see. How do I get down there?
Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?
You did say birds?
I'm simply quoting the law.
Yes, very.
I don't know.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
You're doing fine.
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
Where's Mitch?
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
Lovebirds.
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Yes, I see.  About those lovebirds, Miss...
But how... how do you know my name?
When?
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
Do you practice here?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
Why... 
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
With... with Annie, of course.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
Without any clothes on?
Yes, but...
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
But you tore it up.
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
I have several jobs.
Last night? What do you mean?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
The bay doesn't.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
Hello, Miss Daniels.
You said three o'clock.
Do you have any lovebirds?
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
I'm not sure, but...
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say.
I'm only a student.
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
You have his promise, then?
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
I remember her.
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
We can't be sure of that.
I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?  You can't find him from a wheelchair.  You have to walk and run to find him.
A doctor?
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
This is a gift.
This is a gift you'll not return.
Get out of here!
I've drunk enough tonight.
I would make you rich.
I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
Where are they?
Was that it? Well, ok.
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
Keep that thing away from me.
I was a friend of your sister's.
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
No! Why are you haunting me?
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
Look, can I just call a cab?
Why are there so many?
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
You killed her!
They killed her because she found out.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
Why not, Bobby?
We certainly did.
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
Your impatience is quite understandable.
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
What about him?
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Why not?
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
All together?
Should I run him through?
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
That's right.
Where's Star, David?!
Where you going?
With him?
Leave him alone.
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
Ouch, my hair...
He's just a deep sleeper.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
Michael, are you still in bed?
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
Tell them to get something to eat.
He met a girl.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
Not impressed, are you?
This looks terrific, Lucy.
Max!  What's wrong?
He doesn't walk all over me.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
This room is mine.
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
What about Mom?
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
Anybody sick?
You can't let anybody leave!
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
Cut him loose?
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
Anything?
A couple of hours.
Looks good.
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
Get your gear on.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
We should sleep in shifts.
What's happened?!
This is it?
Morlocks --
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
Excuse me?
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
My God... I saw this.
Alexander.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
You took her because she helped me.
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
That was a foolish thing to do.
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
Well there's something new.
Darling.
I was not.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
Why don't you come to our house instead?
I can't do that --
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
Thank you...
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
How long did you travel?
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
Yes.
All of you?
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
How do you decide?
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
You know this?
You lost someone.
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
Mara -- what -- ?!
It was different then.
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
May I get you some --
No...
Why?
I am the oldest.
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
What do you mean?!
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
I'm fine.
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
He's recovering on the third floor.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
My business?
Do I know you from somewhere?
It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
What should they be looking for?
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
I gave you my dog tags.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
You think Lorenson kills you?
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
They're not here.
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
William, you're not making sense.
[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
How'd he get it?
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
Why not?
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
Don't you go to jail for that?
What were you talking about the other day?
Becker does? Are you sure?
You ever been to jail?
Sure.
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
No.
What's this?
So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing.
Yup. That's me.
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
Well, good for you.
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
I'm sorry.
Honey?
Yes, baby?
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
We're both fine.
No!
Tell us about him.
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
Did you get married real young?
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
Call me back.
Who did it?
Hey, peaches.
Is this your car?
Okay.  I will, too.
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
Why are you actin' like this?
You're not touchin' that car.
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
What did Darryl say?
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
Yeah.
What for?
Why not?!
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
I can see that.
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
Thelma!
What'd I say again?
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
We can live in a hacienda.
You know what's happened, don't you?
How far are we from Mexico?
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
You're a good friend.
So you admit it?
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
Stop it!
It must be great with a wife like that.
Nah.
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
Mary.
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
You own a home there?
By the way, what's your name?
No, I mean
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
No, forget it, it was stupid.
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
No.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
So you found Mary?
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Jai alai?
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
Oh Christ... poor dog.
Your turn?
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
Friend. Baseball bat.
Four.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
What's that supposed to mean?
Have you been up all night again?
So who's the lucky guy?
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
Why?
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
An old flame?
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
Really? I never got a message.
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
Hm?
Twenty-two.
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
Please leave.
Go!
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
You got what stuck?
No, no, please!
I wasn't trying --
Well, there's only one thing to do.
Eh.
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
How does a guy get a rep like that?
Zorin will eat him alive!
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
Oh, still sore about this.
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
When are you going to be home?
I want an hour with him.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Just a second, Mr. President.
Hey.
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
Mr. Clear Moon.
What are you doing?
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
-- did you understand me when I said that --
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
Ray...
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
What did he say?
Why should I tell you.
So what?
Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
This Clear Moon's house?
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
What ya want?
Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
I'll bet!
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
How so?
I saw one.
Where did you see that?
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
I'm different.
Why'd you do that?
It dies. We live.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
You want to go ballistic?
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
Food...and you...my F-14!
Hardly ever.
How does it go?
True.
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
Well what?
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
Let's hope you're right!
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
What?  What is it?
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
What are you doing?
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?
Yawing right.
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
Is there something I should know?
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???
Let me do the talking.
Why do you all have such funny names?
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
Well, I don't know. That depends.
So's my Johnson.
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!
That's because you don't have any women.
Hear about Ice?
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
Nope.
Need a hint?
Just below ten thousand.
Who's the hell is that?
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
Oh, you mean the thrill!
You think I should quit?!
I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
Would you take me back? Would they?
The Last Resort.
Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
I'll go encode your room key.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
The guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form Hauser...All of that was set up by us.
Sorry.  Too perfect.
But I thought...
Eight years.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
What, aliens?
You tell me.
Rekall?
They sell fake memories.
What are you, my father?
Harry, what the hell is this?
I've got a lock!  There!
Quit while you're ahead.
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Let me go!
And you believe him?
Lori, move.
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
It was implanted by the Agency.
I'm honored.
Clever girl.
Nice to meet you.
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
As real as any memory in your head.
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
I love you.
Hauser, you're lost your mind.
Forget I said wife.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
I think you better leave.
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
What can I do?
What's wrong?
Ready as we'll ever be.
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
Yeah, like they got a plan...
What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...
How much you think?
Cannon fuse.
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
Burt, can you hear me now?
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
You know, up the jeep trail.
Howdy, Rhonda.
You're really leaving, huh?
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
You're hung up again.
Fuck you!
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
I'm gonna kick his ass!
What the hell are you doing?!!
Civil?  I'm civil.
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
Darn it!
What's it doing?
I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!
That-a-boy. Hospital.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
It most certainly is.
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
Haven't heard that one before, Ed.  But I guess I'll be hearing it again.
No. No...
We have a full caseload, Rog.
I feel like I've been mugged... Guy scared the shit out of me. You made your point, Eddie... I'm relieved we're not taking the case.
We're taking the other case.
You really think that's what happened?
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
A fucking wheelchair?
What's Art Esparza?
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
My mother find you?
Figures.
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
-- How could I help you?
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking?
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
I followed you here from court.
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
No.
I want you to kill for me.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
We can do it right here.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
That would indicate that it's the future.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
What happened to her?
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
Lil was wearing a sour face.
I don't know, Sam.
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
Call me.
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
No, you should forget about last night.
I can't help you there.
Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
I did? I didn't see anything.
The pages are gone. That's real.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Hey, Jacques...
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
What the hell is wrong with you?
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
Everything, but everything.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
Hiking?
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
What were you doing in my room?
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Yes.
Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
What are you doing?
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
It looks that way.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
Yes.
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Orthopedics?
I know of him.
Anything special about the case?
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
I am on the staff of...
Right. Who called?
Do you know who her doctors were?
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
Hi.
I did.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
I had a witness disappear on me.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Nothing further, your Honor...
D'you find an apartment?
What Hotel are you staying at?
Laura.
Do you think it's my fault?
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
No.
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I can't guarantee that...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
It's locked.
...I understand...
It's a long road that has no turning.
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
I have to talk to you.
I'm going to help her.
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
Are you with me... are you awake...?
What did she do?
The 'History'...?
The broad has disappeared...
What are you doing in New York...?
...of the procedures...
What happened in those three...
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
They've all stopped at the same time.
Can you handle one of these?
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
We will, sir!
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
Can I read it?
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
You get any sleep last night?
Just be careful, okay?
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
Diabetes?
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
He's on his way.
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
I've never mentioned it to him.
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
Yes.
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
I'll call the cops for you.  You've got the number on the fridge, right?
It can be captured, sometimes.
Like the Genie in the bottle.
Me?  Why me?
Guilty.
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
How old are you, son?
Fifteen.
What do you mean?
You okay?
Ninety-six.
Congratulations.
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
Why then.
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
I gotta go.
But that's not the point...
How ya doing?
Jesus, you never told them?
Uh, huh.
What's on your mind?
Stow away?
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
Oh, really?
You do?
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
Tie it off!!
What do you think?
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
It hurts too much to care.
No way Phil.  Not like this.
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
Yes.
It wasn't hard.
The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
What's that supposed to mean?!
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
Thought you said this was a private club. How come I'm allowed in without bein' a member?
Ready for another?
What's that?
When did you talk to Lula?
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
Told ya I would. You still riled?
The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya?
No sir...
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
Sailor... Lula loves you.
Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
What?
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
What brand'd she smoke?
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
That don't seem fair.
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
Sailor!
She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.
What'd you say to her?
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
That don't smell like a More.
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
You certain?
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
More'n likely.
How much we got left, honey?
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
They have, sugar.
And no AC.
You sick?
Yeah?
Love you, too.
And Bobby too, I hear...
Let's leave here.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
What do you want me to do about it?
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
Simple? Kill him? How?
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
Put your shoulders back.
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
By who?
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
You really are one dumb asshole.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
I thought you were tinkering.
He has a book.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
Which is?
What's to tell?
So sensitive.
Crabtree.
Who do you think it is?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
Me? What can I do?
I've been trying to finish a book...
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
Goodbye, Grady.
Yea?
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
Well...
Really?
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
Yea, James.
Whose tuba is that anyway?
This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
What'd he say?
Yes.
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
She seemed to take it pretty well.
Colon cancer.
What kind of dancer?
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
When we fall, we fall hard.
It's warm.
You're lying.
You coming?
It's because you don't eat.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
That good, huh?
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
You got me.
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
Really? That was fast.
Inside.
Grady.
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
He told me.
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
I lost it all.
Did you tell Walter?
I told Walter.
He's writing his name in water.
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
What is it, Grady?
As a heart attack.
George Sanders?
You need a table.
Next week? The week after?
C'mon, Walter.
I get horny as hell for other women.  I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.
Ask me. Ask me anything.
What are you looking at?
There's a million birds here.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
I'm not pretty.
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
The one with the ax?
Know what?
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
I wasn't feeling well.
Can I ask how old you are?
How come?
That's okay... doesn't matter.
They sound like finches.
How do you know?
I don't mind.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
No way.
Why not?
It was just an idea.
Bad idea.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
I don't feel anything.
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
Then why are you talking about this?
How long is this going to take?
I suppose it's however society defines it.
How do they know?
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
Go home, Walter.
You mean my problem?
That's not a helpful answer.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
Who do you see?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
But roughly, how old?
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
You felt pleasure.
Did you get an erection?
There's something wrong with this picture.
Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?
Most women wouldn't choose it.
I'm just quiet.
Are you?
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
What's the problem?
The morning?
I thought I'd stay the night.
The worst?
I molested little girls.
You're not joking.
Look, you can go now.
It's not what you think.
What?
They seduce you?
I know.
What odds?
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
Which brother did this?
All three -- in chronological order.
Are you serious?
What?
I'm not scared.
What's going on?
Yeah.
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
Okay so far.
Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
Wasn't up to me.
I'm switching off now.
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
Well, that's that.
They'll come out after us.
How?
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
Do we just leave him there?
Why bring it here?
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
Are we talkin' little space friend here?
He can still make it.
Would we see the flash?
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
Did you sleep well?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
There's nothing much to laugh at.
Shall we go for a swim?
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
No, Sandro... Please...
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
Who are you talking to?
Looks like the weather is changing.
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
No.
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
Why?
I'm not hungry.
Of God.
Yes Mother.
It made them holy.
I burnt them.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Let's talk about something else.
First thing that comes to your mind?
Oh, I know he does.
How were you sick?
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Not at the moment, no.
You liked Sister Paul?
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
No.
Why not?  Mmm?
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
That you're a mistake?
How does she know that?
What?
To help me.
Because I was afraid.
No.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
Sister Marguerite I think.
A crucifix.
Yes.
Why isn't anyone coming?
Who?
Frightened.
Yes.
She said Michael.
The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.
Why?
She'd seen him too.
So she sent you?
Stay away from me...
Not your fault...
I hate him...
Who?
It was alive wasn't it?
You saw it all didn't you?
Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
Why?
Thanks. 
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
No, no, no...
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
I can beat that.
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
She has it now.
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
???  
Aquittal.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Oh, Dear God...
The sheets...
Sister Paul?
You lied to me
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
Do you know what she did to her?
Don't deny it!
And what has that to do with it?
Long, thin and filtered.
Even Christ would partake socially.
Begin what?
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
I have a few more questions to ask her.
You wanted that child out of the way.
No!
That's enough.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Oh, it's all right.
What about all these letters?
I'll murder that Lennon.
You don't think...
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
That's not your Grandfather.
Sure. .
We do.
Is he?
Well ... come on.
Should I say it?
I don't think that bit's right.
What are we waiting for?
I've got you worried, haven't I?
How'd you guess?
What are you?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Why selfish?
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
And what's it all come to in the end?
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
Oh, they seem all right to me.
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
Behave...
What?
Oh you are, I know you are.
No, I'm not.
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
But John hasn't got any.
What?
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
Engines off.
I got it.  Oh boy.
Then take her down.
I'll go first.
Can we come up?
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
Computer, what language was that?
Where's it coming from?
Okay.
Oh -- God -- oh --
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
It's really on there tight.
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
So does anybody have any suggestions?
It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
Where did it come from?
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping.
If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
The flamethrower!
I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
What do you mean, no?
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
What'd he say?
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
No, thank God... just missed him.
That's the one about the albatross, right?
We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Anything else?
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
Where did the parasites come from?
We won't need it then.
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
What can I do?
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
Where is she?
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.
Where're they headed?
When?
What's going on?
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.
Hey, Guttierez?
What's wrong?
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
You have to...
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
How do you know my name?
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
That's right.
Yes. The Shubert.
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
D-day.
Paved with what, then?
She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
Champion to champion.
It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
Then say so.
I'm tired. I want to go home.
Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
We never met. That's why.
Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer?
Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast!
We have that in common.
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
Frankly, I don't remember.
I take it she read well.
Macbeth.
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
Sing it?
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
What?
Cut it out.
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
For instance - you!
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
Thank you.
Addison-!
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
Okay. Mix.
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
No, I'll tell it to you! For the last time, I'll tell it to you. Because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
You know what I'm going to be?
You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it.
Why?
Just wondered what?
Thanks for your help... good luck.
Yes. Yes, it does.
Is that what you want me to be?
I'm for it.
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
Buy some.
How do you do, my dear.
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
Don't be dense. The party.
How did you get in here?
Try...
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
Hollywood.
Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
The show must go on.
Of course.
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
Let's not get over-dramatic.
- an understudy's performance.
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
No, thank you.  Yes. I've seen every performance.
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
No, don't go...
While you're cleaning up, I'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Well...
Check.
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
You'll break your neck on that ice.
You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression...
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
Margo, you haven't got any age.
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
I'm sure.
What do you mean?
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
It's been quite a night. I understand that your understudy - Miss Harrington - has given her notice.
That depends.
I don't think I could be.
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
Would you?
You get quick action, don't you?
Promise.
I promise.
--no way--
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
Let me lay a little theory on you--
What's that?
--see?--
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
I don't get it... this really was my turf...
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
Did he just say what I think he said?
--we will--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
--shit, who do we know?--
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
--I haven't said anything--
How high up, which Republicans?
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
It's nothing personal, though. 
Woodward?
--jeeeeeeesus--
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
You can't.
But you know who did.
Chapin did contact you then?
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
--you got more than one source?--
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
Give me your checkbook then.
This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane--I would have sprung for a classier place.
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
Something maybe big.
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story.  I don't think we should cover the story, period.
Go on.
I don't know titles.
I have nothing more to say.
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
Your name, please.
James McCord.
And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
No.
It is.
Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
Thanks coach.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Good morning gentleman.
All right, I got some scotch.
Not bad, Chris.
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
I'm glad you think so.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
What?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
Oz, it's okay, I know.
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
Yeah right.
Then what the hell are you talking about?
And you said...
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Right.  That gives us...
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
You're not...busy?
Dad!  I know!
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
What was your name again?
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
This was remade?  Into what?
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
Bullshit.  From where?
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
What the fuck are you doing here?
The key is don't look down.
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
What makes you so sure this will work?
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
No wonder he let her go.
Whoa...
Okay. Be careful.
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
You recognize her?
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
Andy...
Andy? Andy is that you?
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
Why would he pick this one?
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
Merde.
Here.
Saint Severin...
Yes, your highness.
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
I have my reasons.
I'm going to stretch my legs
Come on!
What a beautiful ship!
Oh! I'm sorry...
Don't you, child?
So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
Trust me, it's her!
You'd lose your security deposit?
I'm getting a chest cold..
You're a princess...
What do we do now?
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
No. Empress, you --
I should go
Promise me she'll have her home.
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
It's an important issue.
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.  Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
Two minutes, Alvy.
Alvy, I...
Oooh! Here! Here!
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
You-you play... very well.
You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
Me? Oh, downtown!
Right!  Where?
Uh, you're driving a-
I'll getcha a piece.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Nice car.
You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
Don't be funny.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
Okay.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
what I mean?
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
it's my first time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, all right.
Yeah?
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
H'm?
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
M'hm.
Look at these guys.
Oh! Italian, right?
That's the key question.
Yeah.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
You don't want me to live with you?
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
It relaxes me.
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
M'hm.
and I keep, you know, it's-
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
Will it change your wife?
Will it change my life?
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
It was just great!
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
Step up here!
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
Why are you so hostile?
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
Don't get upset!
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
It's like Samuel Beckett, you know- I admire the technique but he doesn't... he doesn't hit me on a gut level.
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
Yes.
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
Charlie Chaplin.
Hey.
What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
You're crazy!
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
I have some very good memories there.
Oh.
Oh, Jesus.
I don't know, I mean, I-
V.P.L.?
Oh, he-he didn't say anything.
No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
Yeah. Right.
His wife has diabetes!
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Look at you, you-you're such a clown.
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
Well, hi!
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
Yeah.
Would it make a difference?
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death.
Any thoughts on casting yet?
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
She already has.
I'm in mourning.
Didn't I say?
Borrow whatever you like.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Thanks for coming.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
When does he graduate high school?
What is it?
We live next door.
There's a test, you know.
Are you my big hard hero?
I call that a perfect day.
Go.
It was fifteen seconds.
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
Well, you're a tower of support.
He's directing now.
Did he promise?
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
What?
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Hello?  Last birthday was?
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Yes.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
He's my favorite.
We have a gift?
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
It's a novel.
And I you.
You lose this?
You're an interior decorator, right?
I'm a little nervous, so...
Are you okay?
Lemon or raspberry?
Ryan's really angry with me.
I think he's really angry with me too.
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  Because, God help you if something happens to that dog?
What?
We could hardly say no.
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
Yes.
Do you need anything else?
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
Would you, like, marry him?
Are you asking me to marry you?
Are you lovesick?
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
She's even better looking in the flesh.
Fuck you, Panes.
I wasn't finished.
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
I never like to talk about my work.
Like Joe.
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
You weren't exactly horrified.
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
Break's over.
Tell me about it.
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
Are you sure this is a real dance?
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
What <u>was</u> that thing?
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
Want a list?
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
Oh, no, sir!
Not that one.  Or that one.
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.
So this is your mother's apartment?
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Care to make a small wager?
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
Say, you got a lulu.
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
That makes me feel just terrible.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
Yeah.
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
Eight-thirty.
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
The mirror -- it's broken.
Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
I don't understand --
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
Two o'clock.
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Here. How about some breakfast?
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
Who?
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
Cut.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
I know so. He's a taker.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Here.
So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were --  It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.
I mean, after that?
You don't have to if you don't want to --
I never thought he'd do it.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
Oh.
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
Relax, Baxter.
Not that I have anything to hide.
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
You're going to take her off my hands?
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
How's that again?
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
On account of me.
Hi, Baxter.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?
Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
Me?
Want to tell me what happened?
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
I'm not sure.
What's this -- you packing?
Where are you moving to?
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Who?
A.W.O.L.?
I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
And what happened to you?
You fool -- you damn fool.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
Will you excuse me?
Well -- thank you.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
I want you back, Fran.
You know I do.
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
See if they'll what?
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
Winning the war by yourself.
What unit were you with ?
Holy shit.
Call me what, sir?
I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
What are we doing here?
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
Shot himself. What for ?
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
What're you trying to say, Captain --
What is it?
What do you want ?
No, sir.
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
Yeah.
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
Captain?
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
I got bored in Saigon.
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
Don't you agree?
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
Fuck no.
I had immense plans.
You had immense plans... immense plans...
Yes...
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
Nah.
A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here.
Sure.
Captain Willard?
You're Australian?
You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son.
What things?
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
102  CONTINUED:
165  CONTINUED:  
39   CONTINUED:
Six months.
What are you doing?
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
New to the country, kid?
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
How many do you see?
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.
I already have.
How come you didn't let him shoot me?
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first.
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
He saw you and Corbett come in...
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
Do you love me?
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
Have they done blood tests on him?
Emergency room only.
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
Okay.
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
What needs clearing up?
I'm not kidding.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
What's that got to do with it?
Hello?
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
I should've danced with you.
What do you want, Melvin?
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
What are you trying to do to me?
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Good evening.
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
How you doing, great one?
Terrify me?
Yeeeess!!!
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
You going to come talk to me or not?
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
What's wrong?
So you're practically finished, huh?
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
How long have you been freelance?
Tachlinkov.
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
Where have you been, Robert?
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
Who?
Deadline?
Yeah.
Twenty large?  That's all?
Now what?
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
Why?
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
Listen -- I don't even know your name.
It's not the same, is it?
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
Then you went freelance?
Why?
Because I want to know.
No.  Just the first one.
You said you didn't trust it.
No.
Do you think he's here?
What do you think he's doing?
Breakfast.
Really?
Where did you learn it?
Then, we wait.
He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
What did he say?
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
It can be.
Yes.
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
Is this becoming complicated?
No.
Honestly?
Right.
Was nice.
I thought it was interesting --
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
I prefer it like this.
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
It's possible.
Right.
Anything.
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
So how's your work?
But we are underground?
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
An alternative literary venue!
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
Like Custer huh?
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
Thought of everything haven't you.
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
So why didn't we?
No, not if you've got better things to do.
Like a hand?
Red or white?
Don't tell me you really are in love?
What do you want me to do?
If I cut a deal, I'm not staying in this country and I want Holly to come with me. So, if she doesn't come here today, you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after I call, promise?
Some deal you did there!
What about me?
I made a deal with Josh.
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
No, by road?
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
Sure. Excellent.
Turned Czech huh?
So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
Will it help to get you out?
They'll do it.
About forty minutes.
Okay?
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
Will this thing take long?
Why don't we both forget about him?
Weren't you going to get some glasses?
This is your doing?
Why did you break into that particular building?
Enjoying our hospitality?
Really!
Yeah!
We had a deal!
Yeah.
I think we should be going honey.
Go to hell!
You bastard!
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
So go dance.
She's coming over here...
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
Late night.  You?
Were you with Jamie?
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
'I hope your dreams come true.'
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
The play's going to be really good.
I haven't been nice to you.
And why would that scare me?
What does that mean?!
Hey.
Like fire.
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
When did you build this?
You planned this --
Are you trying to seduce me?
One of your secrets.
What are you going to -- ?
Pull over.
Help me live until I die?
That I want you to take me home.
You know how to waltz??
'What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.' Aristotle.
How're you doing?
It's gone now.
Can I -- go out?
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
Up to?
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
I thought she built it herself.
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
Fine.
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
How old are you?
What time does school start around here?
Well... yeah...
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Operator...
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
Catch you later! 
A gold mine?
Professor? Professor Brown?
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
Well, it was there.
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
Perfect...
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
That's what he told you, huh?
Does he bite?
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
We did it, Ray.
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
Then why'd you do it?
Holly's over here, Kit, if you want to see her.
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
Jack.
Yeah. I can imagine.
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
That's my father. I got to run.
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
You want to go for a ride?
What a nice place.
What?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
I can look and see.
How you doing?
I'd like to get out of here.
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.
Yeah.
Really?
Just thinking.
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Dead.  Damnit!
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
And they got Penny!  Look!
This is so embarrassing...
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
Go away.  Let me rot?
Was she pretty?
The girl I remind you of.
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
Oh, my.
You don't wanna know.
Stay here, I'll be back.
What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
Why me?
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
Is, uh... Is he okay?
I see.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his – what about before that?
Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. People who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity – the basest coin there is.
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
Well that's what he said.
...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man – to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
No, what did it say?
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
Well, I'm... glad to hear that –
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
Can be. Not easy, but –
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
...What's the expression – me myself and I.
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time –
...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
What do you mean?
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
Hold on –
You gotta believe me –
We gotta call the police –
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
It's okay... It's okay...
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
What –
...Those your only bags?
Charlie... Charlie's back...
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
When did you start drinking again?
Take care, you hear?
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
How's not smoking?
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
Yes.
You did it for me.
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
Did I miss something?
Because you didn't love him --
Why not?
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
Do you?
Don't get too cocky.
You can make a mistake.
Fine.
Aren't you going to thank me?
Why does he do it?
When did you write it?
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
Fine.  How's your back?
Did you like her to watch?
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
About three months before I met you.
I don't know.
I found Lisa Henderson.
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
No thanks.
What are you researching?
Was she ever a suspect?
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
I don't believe it.
Why not?
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
No Lisa Anderson, detective.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
Why, so you could humiliate me?
Naa..
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
Yeah... Like – stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
That was my favorite part!
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
That's the same guy who did this painting.
B.B. It's me – Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
I'm not black.
Not black.
Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?
We don't hang them at home, y'know – just in the streets..
It's Andy again.
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
What's the rush, John Henry?
Drugs??!
Basquiat, don't lie.  This is smack.
It looks done.
... babies.
What's wrong with me?
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
Don't you think he's using you?
Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies.
Have a Mac.
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
So keep painting.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you?
Hanging on every word.
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
And the truth frightened her?
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
Ten, nine...
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze.  Batman monopolized the evening news.
I'm on break from-
You'd be surprised.
Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
But he's never said a word-
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
The _Rolls_?
Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He's protecting more than industrial secrets, Alfred.
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
...Afraid.
Mystery.
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
How ya doin', Al?
_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
What's wrong?
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
Would you? I'm not so sure.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
What?
The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul?
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
I'm not-
Touchy, touchy.
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
I don't-.
...Not the bat?
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons.  Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours.  New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah.  Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt.  Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
How'd you find us?
Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.
A hit.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Yes?
How much do you weigh?
...Not even a 'thank you'?
How'd you find this place?
What is that?
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
Maybe we should just kiss.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
WHAT?
Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
My brother's a priest, man.
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.
And you want a --
Are they paying you for all this?
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
HOLY SHIT!!
Ali?  What's wrong?
Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
Hi.....  Roses.
Let's get a coffee.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Annie, it's me.
Goodnight Annie.
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
Howls he getting on with the family?
Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
Ahm....
Of course.
Welsh.
off the peg?
Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
We're gonna get paid to score.
Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Damn, huh huh.
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Cigarettes and beer rule! Huh huh.
Dill-wad...
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
You scored with two chicks?!
We're rich in what really matters.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
Here's something.
And your sushi was remarkable.
He might have hurt somebody.
What is going on?
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
That's it!
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
The attic room is locked --
They're... not here anymore.
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
Any particular kind?
It wasn't a joke.
Is there much more of this torture?
You don't have a key?
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
An attorney?
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
... He walked off...
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
Would you care to take it, sir?
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
Fine. He's very nice.
Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
How is Ben feeling?
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
No, thank you.
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
I like to watch.
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
Ben is very ill.
Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
Certainly, Ben.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
A flower...
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
... Then you really are a gardener?
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
Good day, Mr. Chance.
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
I hope so.
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
But you won't sign, correct?
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
Ben!
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
Well, Ben... I...
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
Yeah.
What?
We have to make it an early night.
Hi.
Did you eat?
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
Yeah. You want a beer?
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
I have to go back now.
Why?
What are you doing?
You've always hated the animals.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
And he was with her.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
You fell in love with her first.
The iguana?
A better friend.
I'm sorry for everything.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
Let me try.
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
Yes?
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
Yeah.
Just.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
Tickets to Malkovich?
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
You're late.
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what it’s for.
No.
No. Don't be an ass.
Vegas? What'd you think?
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Yes, my dear?
Do you?
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
But of course.
I'm getting divorced.
No! Don't harm the vessel!
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
When?
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Can I get you a drink?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
I'm getting better all the time.
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
Yeah what?!
Captain Mertin?
What want ye, girl child?
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
Then what do I do?
I likes yellow.
You saying nothing counts?
Not like He punished me.
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
Don't pay to complain.
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
Yes?
What you want?
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
What you want'em for?
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
Yes ma'am..
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
In case of what?
Extra?
Should I wake her?
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
MAMA!
But mama..
She likes this dress...
Out where?
He's sleeping in the church.
The church!
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
Till she showed herself.
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
That's so.
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
You don't know what I think.
No, You looking good.
Yes sir.
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
Sir, please lower your voice--
Yeah.
Where you going, Dude?
Almost five!
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
Oh yeah, how'd it go?
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Please!  Please!
Are these.
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
Of course, you do get the good with the bad.  The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software.  Wave of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
You're not interested in sex?
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
That's really thoughtful but I--
And please don't call her my mother.
I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
Well--yeah, I guess--
Uh-huh.
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
Jeffrey--
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
So...that doctor.
What's your point, Walter?
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
Whose toe was it, Walter?
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
But Walter--
Yeah.
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
Yeah.
Is this your homework, Larry?
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--
Dude?
Shit yeah!
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
It's a heart attack.
Walter--
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!
Dude here.
I don't know, sir.
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
Put me down, you son of a bitch!
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
<i>You'll</i> take him.
What?
Two years.
Where to first?
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
Each day is a little life.
For what?
Why?
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
Why do you hate us so much?
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
I don't like it.
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
Going somewhere?
How can you be out here?
Maybe I don't see it that way.
You're wrong.
Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.
Is something wrong, my friend?
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
Some kind of archive --
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
Just get out of here.
Any progress?
I've been better --
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
But you -- died --
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
What happens then?
LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
We keep in radio contact.
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
What happened to her, where did she go?
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
You don't want it though.
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
Yeah.
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
You have to go.
This is a little nuts.
Does it hurt?
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
That's what Josh and Mike said.
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
Too busy eating us?
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
Yeah. Me too.
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
--turn the camera off--
I'm not finished.
Okay, but--
Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
It's Domini, it's not Domini, I don't care--all I know is <u>I'm</u> not dealing with something--<u>anything</u>-- snuffing me in my sleep. I want to do what we did in the woods-- surveillance of this whole place 24/7, with somebody monitoring those cameras every second. There's something, somebody here, I want to see 'em coming.
What're you nuts--
--it's less than four feet, just--
The four of you really have too much spare fucking time on your hands, don't you?
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
Domini.
Does she, goddamnit??
....Ma'am?
She wants me to talk to you, Heather.
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
No, I--
On the phone. Was it for you?
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
...Well I'll be damned.
Thanks.
...Mm-hmm.
...What?
I reckon I can hear him. TV option, that's a dollar twenty, makes nine eighty-six plus tax.
...Friday?
...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.
Back where?
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?
...What?
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
This.
Where was I?
What?
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
Come into the study a minute.
Okay.
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Who knows you have these?
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Who's this fuck?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Jeffrey nothing.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
Do you like the way I feel?
You can hit me, if you want to.
Do you know?
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
. I. uh.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
No.
It used to make me laugh .but.
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
Whatiya mean?
I want you to hurt me.
Yes.
Do you love me?
I did. are you?
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
There ya go.
Yeah, how did you know?
Yes.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Now, how are you going to do that?
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
Why not?
. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
Yeah?
I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you.  . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
You were late.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
My father has a gun at home.
No.
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Look Jeffrey.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
What?
No.
Well.
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
That sounds great!
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
Nothing like this back home.
This is it for me.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Are you kidding?
Honey, your nose!
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Surprise.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
I see.  How much?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
Your offense?  Why are you here?
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
Because I got caught.
I just got released five minutes ago.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Where do I put this!?
I did not.
It's a family heirloom.
Who's the cheapskate?
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
Sure.
Yeah, well...
I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
I meant every word of it.
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
What the fuck are you talking about, man?
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
Not in front of the kid.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
You can call me Dad if you want.
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
I swear.  On my life.
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
For instance, something like this?
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
I wish there was shit like this back home.
Yeah?
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
Smith.  Hampshire....
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
Second district ...
How much are they paying you?
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Read it.
I think it'll be a success ...
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
Good evening ... Can we pass?
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
We have to find out who else would profit from Marsh's death -- and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal.
I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news?
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
So she knew about his heart?
I think I'm going to make your day.
Cause?
That's what my report will read.
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
What induced it?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
Objection.  The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
No -- but I can get it for you.
Is it Marsh?
She was here?
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
What did you prescribe for her?
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
He video taped you.
I've tried it.
Yes.
--and that he changed his will?
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
Why'd you come here?
You know I can't talk about that.
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
Are you going to represent me?
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.
I thought the subject was sex?
-- And then?
Is it against the law?
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
You and me -- making love.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
Sugar or honey?
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
I can back it up.
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
Yes.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
Oh Jesus.
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
How bizarre!
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
Well, what am I supposed to think?
I can't believe she's making jokes.
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
Oh, yes.
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Help cook?
Then what happened?
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
Do you miss it?
I'm sorry. That was...
My God. How I'd love to see that.
What?
No. I'll do them later.
What?
So what happened?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
No, I'm just saying --
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... 
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
Take me somewhere.
How about Bari?
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
Uh-huh. And?
Am I too heavy for you?
Yes, thanks.
What are you doing?
What do you want me to say?
WHY?
If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
Want anything special for dinner?
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
About an hour ago.
When did she decide this?
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm coming!
Are you nuts?
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
Just try it.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
I want you to do something for me, baby.
Where are we, baby?
Since we was just grasshoppers...
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
Have you ever been inside?
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
Cinn?
What are we doing down here?
Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
That's the past.  It's dead.
What the hell do you want?
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
You was just doing your job.
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
Evidence of what?
You want to get into this now?
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
Know what?
The same way you did before.
No, Gino!
Sit down, Gino!
We're family, Caesar.
Gimme the gun.
I didn't expect --
So, you just got out?
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
What are you talking about?
Violet, please!
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
He didn't see you, did he?
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.
What happened to them?
Fuck.
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
You need the money just like we do.
What did she do to you?
I had to.  You made me.
Now, where the fuck is my money?
Why?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick.
You got the key?
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
A favor?
You're doing everything yourself?
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
He said you lost something.
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
I wanted to apologize.
How long have you been with him?
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
You said he washed the money?
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
An accident.
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
Oh, thank God.
I'm still here.
You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk.
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
-- he went inside! --
Paris.  I live in Paris...
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
...they won't let you go...
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
That's all I get?
I don't think so.
We have to go home, Jason.
Jason Bourne is dead.
Who do you think sent me?
Yes.
...I understand...
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
Did you?
I need a ride out of here.
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
That's what I'm saying.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
Looks familiar?
Where?
I should go.
Okay, so...
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
You knew he was coming.
Oh, Jesus...
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
I don't know. 
Who is it?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
What was I thinking, right?
Shit, we didn't sign in.
What the hell're you talking about?
Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
What?
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
Where am I?
... And then some.
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.
What do I have to do.
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
Sorry ...
Jack!!
SAM! What a surprise!
How much do you know?
Tell me about Layton.
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
We don't make mistakes.
It could all be coincidental.
Jack ...
It's you ... it's you ...
No.
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
Where are you taking me?
Suit me?
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Who is this war against, Sam?
Look at that - right on time.
Are you still following me?
Please, Jill ... I love you.
Go away.
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
Isn't it? Whose is it?
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option.
That's it.
What's the matter?
It's what you wanted isn't it?
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
I won't be held responsible.
You remember Samuel, my son.
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
Sam!!! 
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
My husband's dead, isn't he?
What have you done with his body?
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Monsieur. Quel numero.
Sign here please.
What is it?
Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -
What do they want you or?
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
No, no, that's impossible.
Is she dying?
Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?
Where is she?
Sleeping in the back.
Is this what you gave Mary?
I guess I'll be going.
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
He's going to be all right, right?
IB Bangin.
No, I'd better not.
Yes.
No.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
I think I'd remember that.
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
How can that be? He was getting better.
He was tough. You did all you could.
I've taken that into consideration.
How's he doing?
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Okay, whatta I do?
That's ridiculous.
I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
Shit, shit, shit...
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
How <u>you</u> doing?
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
You're feeling good, aren't you?
I don't like being handled.
No.  No.
No?
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
He excels at gratitude.
Okay.  Let's do me.
Eleven and a half.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
I didn't know you were going with him.
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
As good as humanly possible.
No.
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
I think you're the Devil.
Speaking.
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
Do it then.
It's what he did.  I'm proud of him.
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
What did he say?
Do you want him all the way to the car?
Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
What?
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
One year...almost one year.
Uh-huh.
They said it would be okay if...
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Billion.
You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
Oh, good.
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
Hi.  It's me.
Well, when?
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
I got promoted for things like that.
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
A picnic?
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
Would you like to do me?
If you were an artist you could have created something!
I already told you I'm not.
What!
Alright we're clear.
Is the manager cooperating?
Hi Walter.
What's up, Walter?
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
Yes Walter.
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
You think I'm creative?
Of course I do!
Why not?!
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
What?
It was.
Are you trying to be funny?
Why not?
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
No...look I'm busy...
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
I get it Walter.  I get it.
Hello Mayolia.
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
Don't grab me, okay?
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Dying.
Do you know what time it is?
What's Bobby gonna say?
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
Nothing.
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
No, you didn't.  When?
You're even weaker than the others.
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
He did what he was supposed to.
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
Are you okay?
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
I'm looking for you, actually.
To bring you... your birthright.
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
Time to do what?
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
Uh... gym.
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
Sporting events, yeah.
No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
Don't start with me again.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Interesting.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
Cassandra's really smart.
Pike.
Nicole...
You think so?
What happened?
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
So, we're stupid now?
Ah, you'll be coming back.
You can learn to like it.
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
My right nostril?
The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
Death is like spring training?
Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
Yep.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
Damn.
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
I doubt that.
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
Why baseball?
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.
He did know.
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
Boring.
Settle what?
C ' mon!
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
You're a great catcher.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
Crash Davis?
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
Can I give you my testimony?
You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're- way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout.  You know what that makes ya  Lollygaggers.  What's our record, Larry?
Eight and twenty-four.
Where does he go?
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
You were wandering around.
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Stop -
Okay.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
They payin'?
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
No, no it's okay.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
You never - ?
Sammy.
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
Well, sir, I was just...
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
Thank you.
I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
I - I - I...
You all right?
Why're you crying?
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
I didn't take your pills.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
I bought him a watch too.
Yeah.
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
You threw it away?
Oscar wants you to call him.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
Now you need approval from him to go home?
If she calms down, I will let her in the house.
I am calm!
All right, I will, I will.
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
A record of the arrests...
I just wanna get out of here.
...I got muscled on the street.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
Hey.
Go get a bag, man.
Yeah?
I did - I didn't -
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.
Carmine left?
Artie!
Calm down! Calm down!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
How are you?
It's in all the papers.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
I understand.
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
Oh, come on.
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
Mm-hm.
Yes, you did.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
A sponsor.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
You fucked with me for the last time!
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
Yes!
I'm always here for you.
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
We'll go later.
Here.
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
Are they out now?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.
Come here, come here.
This is Nick.
...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.
It's up to you.
They're havin' a good time too.
Sue me, you Jew fuck!
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Fuck you!
Tony.
How you doin'?
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
What's the matter with you?
Again!
I know, but that's enough.
Guilty. I am.
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
She has a real spirit.
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
But I'm blind.
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
You could've made me lose my call.
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
Then whose is it?
You gotta just look the other way.
You could've killed us.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
Because you know you'll be killing us.
I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
The cops could trace this call back to you.
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
Oh man.  These people mean business.
I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
Stop throwing names at me.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
Hey drop it, okay?
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
The one in Brentwood.
I might still get there first. The lights are with me.  How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
No.
Lucky for them they didn't.
Why can't it be her?
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
You're going to let them get away with this?
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
You were at the Emerald that night?
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
Why are we stopping?
What's really on your wicked little mind?
What's your point?
I'm handling it.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
You'll see her.
It's in the process.
Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
The fuck I will!
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
I can see the benefit in that.
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
I thought so.
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
So who's he?
What you think?
Who the fuck is he?
Take your clothes.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Fuck off back to Essex!
You American?
And what's it like?
You all right?
What look?
You say that like a gentleman.
Depends what it is.
Come on, Dil --
Don't call me that.
See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
That's a start.
So they do know.
Don't ask me in.
Should have stayed a girl.
So I got it wrong, then.
Shouldn't be, Dil
You could say that.
And you're not going to tell me more?
You'd do anything for me?
You want another haircut, baby?
Why?
Why?
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
So tell me.
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
You do?
Dil!!!
Tell me what she wore.
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --
Thirty-five.
Please, Dil --
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
Have a look at him.
He's all right.
Leave us, Judie.
I heard.
We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Perfect.
And what happens then?
I take pride in my work.
Why would you do that?
Back in a minute, Jody
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Why?
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
A hotel?
Right.
Eat something, would you?
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.
I'm talking about your people, not you.
What the fuck am I doing here.
Ever see hurling?
Never.
See? I was right about you.
Where would you most like to be now, man?
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Who's Dil?
That you guys shouldn't be here.
Want you to do something, Fergus.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
Go to sleep now.
Not here.
Have you no feelings, woman?
That fucker's dead --
You're crazy --
Where are you, ol' buddy?
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
I think that's what you ordered.
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
You're going to look for him -- now?
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Reggie -- listen to me!
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
I said, tell me to go to the --
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
Oh, I see.
Thanks very much.
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
Agents.
That's not Carson Dyle.
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Yes -- ?
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
It's Charles!
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Bartholomew?
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Scobie?
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Sure.
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
Okay.
What are you doing?
The phone's ringing --
That sounds like their problem.
What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
Fiction or non-fiction?
Well!
But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
Monsieur Félix -- ?
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
Yes.
He didn't have one.
Where did he keep his money?
Is that all? Can I go now?
I don't understand.
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Voilà what?
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
How do you know?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
I don't know where to go.
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
What was what?
We're here.
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
But why do you want a divorce?
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
How can you tell?
What's he up to?
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
I'm glad. But what's all this?
I don't see him.
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
I get all your CDs.
is there anything you do?
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
I want you to head right home after school.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
Who is she Daddy?
What did you hear?
She's not here.
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
I know where you're going.
You gave me a 'D'.
I'm sure you should have failed.
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
Of course I'm scared.
Yes.
You're the killed.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
What are you doing?
That's what he said.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
Who?
Ok.
No.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
...shit.
Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle. We are carrying a damn bomb...
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.

Well, he told me to collect cash.
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
...-ed.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
Yeah, borrowed!
You're nuts, goin' back there!
Doesn't work.
...work!  It's not even load-...


...-er!
...you.

Oh, shit.
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!

Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete.
 Oh...
Get over!  Get over!
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
...Pete.  Come on.
 Oh...
 ...shit!

All right.

I don't want you to come anyway. 


Uh-oh.
Worth a try.

Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
That is loud!  I'm 

Huh?
We're gonna die!



Okay, here we go.
You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
...-natic.
Stop.
Oh, shit.
We!
  I've got the real thing!
...here comes the...
Whoo!
What the--?
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Hold this. 

Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
Okay.  Come on, big guy!


Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
You.
Oh!
You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
This country trained me to kill...
...help you?

Listen, deputy.
...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
...to be off the island tonight.
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
...-ple.
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
Or I may be wrong.  The breeze could be gusting south.  That'd be Billings...

Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  He'll be more useful now.
Hit him.
I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-...
Where's their protective...
Mornin'.
I assume you have one.
I want you to look at one another...
You'd never understand!

I can handle it.
Ah.
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major!
That little geek is my...
Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?

Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
What the hell are you talkin' about...
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
...-time. 
Tie a fly...

Yeah, I just....
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
 ...miles. 
We've got the real thing!
...tunnel!
...seriously.
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
 Listen, Pappas...
Don't move!

Negative.  Negative.
He must've had a damn arsenal in there.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
A ruler?
They're calling it an accident.
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
Curly, where's your car?
I said okay, Jake.
Then what'll you do?
No.
I don't.
Isn't that your number?
What are you talking about?
What's the maid's address?
What for?
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
Would you like something to drink?
Mrs. Mulwray?
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
Well, how much would you like?
I have?
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
K... Cross.
Yes... why?
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Oh, yeah?
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
I'll stay.
What's wrong?
You bastard.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
Yes.
What does it look like?
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
Did you get some sleep?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
...where does Kyo live?
Sophie.
I don't understand.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Mr. Gittes?
What about the water?
Yeah.
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
No, really?
...Yes of course.
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
Gittes.
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
Not exactly.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
No...
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 
Why? What do you mean?
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
We'll talk about that later.
Who?
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A new broom sweeps clean.
Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
You know why?  She was so -
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
There is no news big enough.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
And the notice?
That's Leland, isn't it?
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
Emily, you -
Where's the soap?
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
A chicken?
Is that what you want to do?
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0
Half past eleven.
I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
I'm not sorry.
I won't let you go.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
Close the door, Raymond.
Oh, yes, sir.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
Yes?
What?
I'd like to talk to you about that.
All right.
She's going to leave you -
Yes.
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
I know, but -
If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
Are you sure?
Are you serious?
You're shittin' me.
It's not the same.
Excuse me, but...
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
I think you'd better leave now.
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
Can I join in?
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
You're just going to lock the store like that?
You saw it?
I'm not pregnant.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
Sang? His name is a past tense?
There's more, isn't there?
You lie.
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
Jesus, you're caustic.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
How'd you get here so fast?
I left like an hour ago.
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
What time was this?
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
Nobody. It was closed.
With this guy locked in?
This is the last time I come to this place.
Are you open?
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
Pack of cigarettes.
So?
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Eight and a half?
Allan Harris.
That's frightening.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
And you figured it out?
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
Each egg has to be perfect.
What kind of show?
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
No.
Why not?
Why'd you apologize?
What?
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
Don't yell at me, pal.
At least we're stuck here together.
What happened to all the Gatorade?
Why not?
If you go, I go.
Twenty-two; same as us.
Broke his neck.
That's embarrassing?
Stop it.
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
Why should I loan you my car?
Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
Get to work.
No way!
You're happy to get a fine?
What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
I didn't strain. I sighed.
I don't think so.
How much can you bench?
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
A half hour.
With you? I don't think so.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
We were going to start again, I think.
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
How much money did you leave up there?
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
And I actually date you?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
I touched a nerve.
Including you?
No; who were the three, besides me?
They put up the least amount of struggle.
He requested this?
Why do you say that?
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
How many dicks have you sucked?!
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
A few?
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
Thank you for being rational.
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
Veronica, I love you...
You hold the counter and I'll pull.
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
It stings a little.
Can I have your name please?
You said you were here all day?
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
He's your cousin?
What did he say?
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
No way!
Feel that.
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
That's the price, my brother.
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
I'm not sad.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
That woulda been cool.
Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
Looks like the Tower.  It's a bad climb.
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
Throw it up or I'll kill her.
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
I don't understand?
Why are you yelling?
A flare up...
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
What are you doing here!?
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
I can't believe you just said that.
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
We don't have time to argue about it!
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
What about you?!
Got to be Comb Bluff.
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Why didn't you send the money over?
Don't use my name!
Get off my back, Qualen!
Man against nature, right Travers.
Is it set?
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing.
The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
Good evening.
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.
I beg your pardon?
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
Good.
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor and from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! Name?
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
No, sir.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
Yes!!!
How are you feeling today?
I haven't seen you before.
Just part of hospital routine.
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
How many did I get right?
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
Shall we go to my office?
The ride is free.
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
It's no big deal.
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
Oh, my, yes.
I'm sorry.
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
What are you gonna do?
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
What if they're wrong?
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
What's your name?
I'm standing right here.
Oh.  Oh, thank God, hey!  Hey, guys, hey, help me out here!
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
Twenty-four minutes.
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
You should start a union.
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
Like what?
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
Two, two-fifty.
With what?
You better?
How can you kill him like that?
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
I don't know any Rwandans.
Why?
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
What?
I never learned jazz.
I'm not catching a melody.
Let him go, Vincent.
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
It's not bullshit.
Paid sick leave?
Would you have called her?
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
That's the reason?
Then what are you?
None of your business.
Slow down.
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
What happened?
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
What're you thinking, Jerry?
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
What was your horse's name?
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Them who?
Flat, wraparound headlights?
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
You okay?
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Never, but I've been practicing.
Is he dead?
Did you see the van back there?
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
Okay, I will.
You will?
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
What is it?
Liza?
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
Blue moon... Blue moon...
Geronimo is down.
I love you, too.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
I'm leaning toward no.
And you feel bad for it?
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
A dog.
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Yes.
Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.
Agent Lowry.
I want to believe you, too.
And Jonas?
He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
There's no plug to pull.
What?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
Meaning...
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
Ellie.  Pulsar?
It's beautiful.
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
And a hundred mile airspace.
Is that your official response?
Could we hear to China?
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
Am I one... or many?
... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
No!  I mean... why so soon?
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
Not if you think like a Vegan.
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
It's so... small.
Hokkaido Island.
Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
Someone tell me this is really happening.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
Do you love your parents?
Yes.  Very much.
Some of my best friends are scientists.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
I'm sorry.
What?
I can't do this --
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
Hey, Tattoo!
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
But there's still daylight left.
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
We got it locked in the sock.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
But, Luke...
Luke. Where you goin?
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
But -- but --
You ain't man enough to wear them!
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
I want to die.
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
We'll get the paramedics...
You already made the delivery?
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
She's supposed to have it.
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
In jail.
Who was the man in the basement?
Who is this?
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
For months... last October.
That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
But it's a different m.o.
That's not consistent... You said they never changed their style, they're robots...
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
Halloran.
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
I don't want this.  What are they?
It's gone.  The file's not here.  What did you do?
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
Because it's your job, that's all.
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
Put in the Kevin Costner.
Where were you?
Not a lot of action here.
That's going well, then.
It is?
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
Do you find him attractive?
No. But when he's in that car...
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
One of your suitors?
I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
So - why the airport?
Yes.
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
Can you drive?
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
What?
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
And the party?
It'll be fine.
You did the right thing.
Are you sure, Dear?
Tell us every detail.
Mom, please.
Don't be fresh.
Green spot.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
But you're checking it out.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
For a price.
What's my rap?
No way.
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
So, it's over?
Where to?
Hey.
Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
Something like that.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
What do you want to do?
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
You can get out of the dinner.
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
No.
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
I love him.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
I need someone to work on budget projections.
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
Agent Hadley.
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
Where are the tapes?
A pass.
They left about a half hour ago.
You're there now?
Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
Why are you here?
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
Why didn't you tell me about this?
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
What kind of business?
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
Hopefully no one.
Do they come with batteries?
I thought they came with batteries.
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
This is Zero.
It's not?
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
I will.
Yeah, French guys from France.
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
Okay boss.   Where are they?
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
The map said to go left.
There has to be.
What about transportation?
We've got to get out of here.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
Mr. Taylor?
Fuck you, grease-ball!
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
He speaks about himself in the third person?
I think we went the wrong way.
You're not helping.
Algeria.
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
I can't even hear myself think.
What does arresting us get them?
Sounds boring.
I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
A little?
And if I use them to kill you?
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
You're already a thief.
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
You don't seem to understand.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
I've missed you.
You're doing calligraphy?
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
I'll give them to you.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Lo?
You shouldn't have come.
Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
You were enlightened?
What was it?
Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
No, not yet...
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
You think Jade Fox will show up?
I'll look around and catch up later.
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
What in the hell... do you call that?
Talent. Hi.
No onions though, okay?
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
That's ancient history.
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
Another jolly nickname?
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
Don't waste my time.
Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
That's right.
I'll be fine.
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
You promise not to say anything?
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
Please.
What? Another letter from your friend?
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
About what?
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
How are you today?
Give it up.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
And that's a bad thing?
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
Somerset Maugham.
I'm doing some volunteer work.
Need any company?
Okay.
Oh please.
What?
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
No.
Am I bothering you?
You know what? I don't take it back.
Why are you doing this?
Where are you going?
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
What are you saying?
But you knew this was important to me.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
I don't think that bothered him.
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
I'll see you tomorrow.
What are the boys like?
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
Are you for real?
See that wasn't so bad.
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
Why?
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
Want a blow job?
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
She bought it.
Where is she?!
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
I'm working on it.
Call me later.
I'm at your service.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Shut up.
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Oh yes.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.
No, I'm not.
Well done.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
Excuse me.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Do you know where she is?
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
How?
Yes, darling.
Do you know the people?
Well — the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
Oh, thank you, darling.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
Hello, Amy.
I got lots of presents.
Where did you mail them?
What do you want. Amy?
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
But...
Daddy?
Who are you?
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
The numbers simply don't mean anything
A princess?
This is more fun than just pretend.
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
Your children?
Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
But why?
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
I'm trying to.
But what happened to the little deer?
It got hit.
I hate the storm. I hate it!
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
No.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
There was a sale.
How have you been feeling?
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
He hasn't said one word to me.
Do you really need these?
Can't you get contacts?
Where are all the mediums?
He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
So did you do it?
No, did you fuck him?
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
And then?
Are those Mark's?
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
I haven't gotten it yet.
Did you get rid of Mark?
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
What happened to his tooth?
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
No.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
"Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
Yes I do have to pee!
Where'd you get the bike?
It's a matter of life and death.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Are you following me?
So what book did you buy?
My mom used to get PMS too.
I'm sorry.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
No. I was doing my laundry.
Everything okay?
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
Worse than this?
What about... those guys... I might have...
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
No, I have a cat.
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
You're some catch Lloyd.
He was found a few blocks away.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
What?
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
What are you talking about?
So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
And that was 28 days ago today.
Doctor!  What brings you here?
Good evening, sir.
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnít with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, howís your mother?
Sorry, sir.
What?  Who has?
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
I didn't realise...
What does she say?  The woman.
Your name is John White.
I have to go...
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
You've been working too hard.
And we're going away for a holiday.
Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today.
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
I was a senator, you know.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
He's only doing what you told him to.
It's not his job -- It's my job!
Bob...
Don't do this.
I don't think so
This is undeclared income.
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
At a press conference.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
Does it make the cars any better?
Oh... Thanks.
Oh... Hi.
You ever think back to how you started.
Really?
You ever use it?
No.
The Vice-President...
What are you staring at?
When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
I know.
I can't.
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
What's wrong?
They're crucifying you out there.
You really believe that?
The Monroe?
What about the intro?
Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad.
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go.
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
What you wanna do?
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
Step up here, Tyler.
Tricks...Jesus...
Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.
I don't think they're in school.
Cameron, what is the matter with you. You act like they're your mother or something.  You afraid of them?
It will?  How do you figure?
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
How'd it go?  Did you read it to her?
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
Doing fine, sir.
Who else was involved in this?
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Charlie...
That's your sister school, right?
Sort of.
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Just like that?!  You just knew?
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
Uh-huh.
What is that?
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Very good, Mr._?
We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Good god, boy! Yell!
Yawp!
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
I was just looking in an old annual and...
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.
I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  It's just a bunch of people trying to impress Nolan.
I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck.
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
What is it?
A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
But if he said no before then...
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Er  No.
Neil, you're not gonna...
Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
This play?
No thanks.
Who are you?
Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!
And what? These things are octopusses?
You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
Where are my men?
Maybe we lost them.
I'm not staying here!
Now look what you did!
Jesus Christ lady...
Self sufficient...
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
The "come back" kind.
It's not them...it's it...
Yeah...
You want ME to go up there?
Can we use our indoor voice please...
I've never seen you so congenial with a mamber of the opposite sex... The two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport...
And what have you come up with?
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
What is it man?
Fucking women, man...
You want 'em?
What?
Who's going?
Nick's going?
Here's to huntin'.
Ammo! Get the ammo!
Who's full of shit?
I'm telling you, they changed it!
I thought that was it.
I do!!!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married!
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
Yeah.
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
You mean...?
Naw.
Nick! Hey, Nick!  Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?
Not so good.
Sal.
Kind of. You didn't know?
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
Linda, Linda...!
Naw, it's... I mean...
Nick?
You're going hunting?
Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
Yeah.
Nick, he just came back.
Pow?
You think we'll ever come back?
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
What else?
I thought you might be praying.
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
It's Merle, Sal.
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
Yeah.
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
Up I would say... What would you say?
Down.
What did you say?
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
I want to see my wife and kid.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
Sir, your limo's here.
I got it.  I got it.
Got it.  Ejection seat?
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
Bacon cheeseburgers.
GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
Why?
Wanna try?
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
How ya feeling?
You be careful.
This little thing says I can't.
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
What are those people doing there? What do they want?
You know that you're in my house.
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
Young man -- you got me there.
And what about Daniel Webster?
Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
-- in gold.
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
Mornin', Jabez ...
Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late.
Now run along, Daniel.
Don't say that -- I know it is --
Opportunities?
Well, I'll be -- 
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
I don't care.
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Why -- good morning, Squire.
But -- I was just lucky.
Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
Oh, Jabez.
I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
Well -- what are we going to do?
Your butter money?
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
It feels fine now, Jabez.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
Why don't they come --
Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
Jabez -- Jabez!
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
Ma -- is she? --
Come in, Sheriff.
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?
Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
Why don't you?
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?
He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.
Nein, dies ein ist mein.  This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
...I've missed you.						*
You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
How do you know?
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
Al?  Al, you there?
Hey, you couldn't know.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
Jesus, you're the man!
Aw, hey...
You'll be okay.
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
Heidi, I'm dying.
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
What are you talking about?
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
Why you going to Algeria?
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
He's makin' threats in there.
Yeah.
One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
Call me whatever you want.
I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
What the hell you doin' back there?
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
What else?
Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites!
Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?
Yeah?
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
No, not until after they killed him.
Because I don't want cancer.
Let's go, Sonny.
It's the cops.  Shit!
... The bodies out the door.
Okay, Sal ... what do we do?
We'd kill ourselves.
Yeah ...
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
I can't allow that, Sonny...
What are you trying to pull?
Hey, you okay?
I said you were never a faggot.
Oh.  Run.
Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?

You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
And...?
Wow, you are smart.
It's a surprise.
You got the Extender?
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
What happens now?
You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
I can assure you...
I'm sorry Gurney.
This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord.
Do you know this my lady?
Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
You mustn't speak of...
Those sounds could be imitated.
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
Why were you buying a coffin?
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
Who do I play?
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
Ah!  This is very exciting.
What's in the needle?
But maybe not.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
Sorry...
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
What do you think you're doin'?!
And who may you be?
Isn't he?
Dolores, give me your shoes.
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
Toss us out on our ass.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
That's not true --
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
Raising money is tough.
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
Tor, I should be getting home.
My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
So you're not gonna make the movie?
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
Are you a fruit?
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
Isn't he dead?
Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
"Where's the ads"?!  The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri!  You schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.!
I just picked them up on the way over...
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.
What was that?
Uh, atomic energy?
I can't get it to go up.
Huh?!
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat --
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
I'm really sorry...
You don't wanna be noticed?
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
What octopus motor?
You know, to make the legs move --
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
Vampira!  Hi, this is Ed Wood.
Do they show it?
No! Do they show you having sex?
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Did you see that?
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
Uh-huh?
They tore her dress! ...
Great line.
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
Send him away.
No.
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
St. Joseph's.
What?
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
Ma...
Right, yeah --
What is she, at work?
She won't.
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
How much less?
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Okay ...
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
Oh God, this is so weird.
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
There's a list.
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
Okay.
Where were you?
What is?!
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
Hi.
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Are you busy tomorrow night?
Can I help with anything?
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny.
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
Tracy.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
So Tracy?
Doing what?
Just wait outside. Tammy.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Hey Yeah?
What do you mean?
Okay, let's say
She's doing this to get back at me
We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just --
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
Paul, get out!
How's the left these days?
Can I get you a drink?
Yes.  But do you know?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
It's Lynn.
But you did it anyway.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
I don't know.
Captain, what do you want?
Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
You know him?
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
Stens?  Was it Stens?
One in six.  Where's the girl?
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
Of course...
Thanks, but no thanks.
Against your code?
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?
Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
I don't have time.  I have --
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Man, what're you saying?
You're wrong.
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
What's this all about, lad?
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
What about you?
L.A.P.D.
Damnit...
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
Bud White's been here?
Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
Some reality.
Why not?
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
Where will you go?
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
Under the house.
Is she?
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
Pacific Coast Bell.
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Um...who's that?
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Listen--
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
We've also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.
Really?
Who was that other guy?
Who are they?
Okay.
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
What if--
What do you mean?
What'd I tell you?
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
How'd you get around the tap orders?
How'd you have the manpower to--
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
Why'd you leave?
Yeah.
Here?
Think we let out enough air?
These guys are incredibly persistent.
Reynolds.
What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?
Baudmore Consultants.
The thing is...it really can't wait.
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
Yes. I have her permission.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
No.
For your wife?
Hey.
Right.
Bobby?
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
Stacy?
"Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
You <u>swore</u>!
I think you should leave now, Robert.
I know, but listen--
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
Just reporters.
My suitcase--
Brill.
Never.
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
We're screwed.
I'm gonna fix it.
We'd rather not--
My shoe?
I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
Excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year old boy, good looking, about yea-big.
You're learning a cruel lesson.
He's kidding.
Yeah.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
What about jewelry?
Bobby--
They killed Rachel.
I have a family.
Yeah?
Bobby--
It's been a few years.
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
He had help.
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Yes?
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
Then let's assume I don't.
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
You should come into the shelter.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
Do they know them?
Will you please come in?
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almásy nods.
It's a folk song.
Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
Shall we be all right?
Why did you hold his collar?
Oh dear.
Could I trouble you for some water?
Her hands and feet were tied.
And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
In my room.
Why do they care about our maps?
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
May God make safety your companion.
Is this you?
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg in…have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
So was my Patient.
I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
Supper. Hana calls after him.
I liberated it.
Irving Berlin.
Top Hat.
What?  You and Madox?  Or you and Katharine Clifton?
The rest meant nothing to me.
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
He needn't disturb you.
Why?  Is he staying?
I've been told that before.
Arguing about books.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
So I follow the wires?
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
You've got a mustache.
They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
Through a window.
The windows don't open.
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
We've got to catch him in the act.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
Too late now.
No you can't.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
You're not taking me seriously.
And I thought we were getting on so well.
Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
You can't.
Possibly.
It's a test.
Fine. What do I do?
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
What the hell was that?
That's entrapment.
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
That's because I wanted them to!
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
Got it.
Your share.
We're living history here.
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
Well...What are we doing?
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
The oscilloscope's already programmed.
Got it.
You can't be serious.
Can't be too careful.
It was wrong to deceive you.
But would you--would you--
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
That's because you grew up rich.
Relax, don't jam it...
Come on.
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
Gin, really.
We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not.
I figured that out.
See you.
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
What's she doing here?
So you say.
She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
Wow.  Why would they do that?
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
Yeah.
No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
You never called me back.  I left messages.
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
Excuse me?
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
Course I did.
-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
You think there's more?
They skipped that step.
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
Hey.  I like working with you.
Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.
Someone's following me.
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
Is that what you want?
I'll see what I can do.
Whoa.  No shit.
Counts?
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
Erin --
I did.  Both.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
Two million dollars?
How many counts?
I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
What's going on in there?
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible.
No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
Which number do you want, George?
C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
What're you doing?
What?  But you been working so hard --
You are someone.
Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
Nothing.
What do you want, a joke?
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
What time is it?
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
Someone stole my stuff.
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
I know.  It's an awful lot.
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Yes, My Lord.
Much anger in him, like in his father.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
Sit down, and shut up!
Not you?
An Imperial probe droid.
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
Hey!  Someone's still in here.
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
A mining colony.
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
I have followed my feelings.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
I'll die first.
And we can watch ...
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
Primitive?
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
I thought he was, but he came back.
Shit.
I see your point. What's the favor?
Dream on, blue eye.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
Shut up, Plissken.
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
Locked.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Does he know how to activate it?
Where is it?
Looking to get out.
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
Who?
How do we get out of here?
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
Find Cuervo Jones.
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
You're running out of time.
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
Where's the anti-toxin...?
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.
So be it, to the death.
My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it.
Who is Merlin?
It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
In the great book.
Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
Why?
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
The law forbids it.
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
I will run.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
The oath. You didn't say--
How about Lankaster Merrin.
No, he's working on another book.
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
Maybe the circuit is busy?
What didn't he tell you?
Me too.
May I ask...?
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
Oh, she'd love it.
How are you today?
Is it coming out Willie?
A stimulant.
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
Convulsion?
We still think the temporal lobe...
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
Yes am.
Pretty close?
Sure did.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
I didn't get you?
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
No.
No, is Regan aware of it?
Please.
What's the difference?
What did you do today?
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
Yeah.
Oh, Captain Howdy....
Regan, why are you reading that?
Well you know it's okay.
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
I don't know, I just thought.
Why does God let us get tired?
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
I came to say goodbye.
It would bring us together.
In time.
No momma.
Save your servant
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
You're not my mother!!!
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
Yeah, a fall.
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
Miss?
How old are you?
It's our goddamn car!
So?
Swimming trunks.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
Piano.
Accident?
That's not the point.
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Cindy.
You got weird kids, Frank.
You look awful.
Seeing anyone in particular?
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
Your older brother.
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
What?
You're getting cold feet about this.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
See anything?
Last?
Unless you want the right.
Why would I mind?
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
Two hours ago!
She's a big girl.
He was just having fun.
You could've come.
We're not getting paid then.
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
Five years ago.  November.
You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
Sick?  How sick?
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
Do I look like I'm naked?
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
Uh... good.
They're tight.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Give me that.
Hey!
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
Baker's unabridged.
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched onto.  She a local?
Born and bred.
How come?
Brought it.
Is that the way it is?
No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
So why's he do it?
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
I can keep the beat.
All I said was you were good.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
You were good.
Oh. So what's it doing here?
Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
Another five years, huh?
How'd the show go?
Yeah?
Merry Christmas, Jack.
You mean if I get sick?
... Thanks.
Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
Is someone there?
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
It can't be.  It's impossible.
They're too tight.
I won't tell mom if you don't.
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
What happened?
Commander, what are you doing here?
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
What's that?
You'd have to start immediately.
The hospital.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
Nothing.
-- Yes.
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Excuse me?
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
Hello?
Mr. Mintz.
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
What’s going on here?
Where’s my real dad?
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
Big Ed’s?  Big Ed’s Tires?  Why...?
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isn’t the life I dreamt about.  Where’s the romance, where’s the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can’t have...
Damn...
Hey, I’m doing the best I can...  I’d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
So could you write down her exact address?
It wouldn’t really be cheating...  It’s complicated.
I’m telling you, those rules don’t apply to me, Arn.
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
C’mon Jack...
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
Miss me, Jack?
Give me my goddamn life back!
It’s a glimpse, Jacko.
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesn’t work like that and I can’t tell you why.
That’s it?  That’s all I get?!  A glare?!
I’ve got kids, I’m going home...
Evelyn, right?
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  I’m putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Don’t  go, Jack...
You mean don’t go at all? What about my internship?
Go. I’m sorry, you should just go...
Jack...
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
...my feet are hurtin’...
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Shouldn’t we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
I think it worked out okay, don’t you?
If you want to look at it that way...
You want the cake!?
Say it, Jack...
Nice, Jack.  You’re sweeping me off my feet.
I need to tell you something.
Worse, you mean...
But you always seem so certain.
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
Think bigger.
Are you okay, Jack?
Not with what they pay me...
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Don’t do this, Jack... But he continues...
Peter Lassiter...
He certainly has your number, Alan.
For the money, they’re hands down the best radial we carry...
Last night was great...
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
Those yours too?
The shields on the station should protect us.
You got a chisel round here?
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
You look like an eighties rock band.
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
What do you mean "complete"?
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields.
This is wrong in so many ways.
Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.
So are you!
Me like-y.
Not this again --
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
Are you kidding?
There were a lot of variables to consider --
What are you doing?
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
I can...make it work.
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
You said it was urgent.
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
Yes?
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
We can't take a second more.
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
Doctor, we've just about had it.
At an operation?
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
May I?
Any reserve air?
That's it...
Was there any damage?
Then don't drift down further.
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
Or your fucking wife, you know.
No.
...Would it kill you to say something?
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
Yah, but that TruCoat -
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan.
How ya doin'?
...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.'
White Bear Lake?
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
Uh-huh... A what?
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
Can you be any more specific?
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
A subconscious-type thing.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
What's the next step here, Jerry?
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know. Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots.
You bet.
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
Huh? Yah?
Hon? Got the growshries.
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
Yah, well, they exist all right.
Yah, how much money was that?
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Yah!
Yah.
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
Yah.
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
There's two of 'em, Lou!
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it!
Yah?
No, no, that's fine.
Anyone else residing there?
Hello?
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Yah.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Copy.
Whose car?
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
It's just the three cent.
The first rule of Project --
Better than I've ever been in my life.
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
No, I wasn't aware...
No, you can't die of insomnia.
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
I want that.
Looks like this is goodbye.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
Like testicular cancer?
It's time for you to leave.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.
That... sawing and hammering.
Guy or girl?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
Tyler...
I'm not paying this back.  I consider it "asshole tax."
Tyler?
You were in here last Thursday night.
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
It's getting exciting now.
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
This is how I met --
Insurance'll cover it.
Yes, you can.
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
Go ahead.  Say it.
I don't know about this.
What fight?
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
What car?
What?
Doesn't matter.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Promise you won't.
Promise?
As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
We don't need him...
I asked you what you studied.
Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
I don't know!  Nothing!
"Too young?"
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
Answer me, Tyler.
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
...to let this happen!
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
Look at me...
Did you hear what I just said?!
What are you doing?!
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
What do you want me to do?
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
Random, sure.
A Trans Am.  That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Here's what I don't get.  For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
Do you remember what triggered it all?
New life defeats death?  Follow the signs?  Where the hell did you find that guy?
You can't cheat destiny.  I know what I have to do to save us.  I have to die.
What is it?  What are you?
I mean it.  Take care of it.
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
That... him?
No.
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
Stop the car!
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
Fag.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
No.
Ninety.
Show me how it operates.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
How do we get upriver?
Why's that?
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
I do?
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
John.  My name is John.
I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
Christ almighty.
I know.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
American.  Come to get you out.
Hello, John.
Those men are all dead.
We left some people behind there, John... POWs.
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...
I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
You still believe in God?
Can I have my desk please.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
What does that mean?
See, I told you!
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.
Where?  Maybe we can.
Remember. One chorus and out.
Come on now...You can't sit here.
How un-sixties of you.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
What girl?  I didn't notice.
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
Where am I?
Where -- ?
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
So what? You going to help me?
.....What are you doing?
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
In a bar called Hellfire.
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
You a fag too?
Are you all right?
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
It sounds exciting.
How do you know him?
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
I'm not.
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
I didn't get it, did I?
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
You want me to hold the chicken.
Now don't...
You always do this to me.
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...
Tita, I've got to go...
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
Like what?
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
You're leaving?
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
That's dangerous, you know.
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
Is he?
Where are you going?
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
Catherine...
Four or five years.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
What?
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
And what about love?
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
Well...
That's an old maid's tale.
Well, she was.
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
Don't fuck wit' me! Don't fuck wit' me.  My lawyer's so good he'll have you workin in Alaska, so dress warn.
I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated.
Then don't go out with me.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
No.  What you do today?
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
I won't let my motha cut my hair.
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
How old is he?
I think he's 18 or 17.
So what do you want with her anyway?
Probably.  One of the many.
Unbelievable.
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
I ought to get some sleep.
It was planted on me, sir.
You can't keep me here.
That's Babar.
I don't know. I don't have any.
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Like when?
You don't know me.
The two surfer boys?
Thought so. What for?
What?
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
I'd have been long gone.
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April.
John Ultramalensky, right?
It’s okay. The cops did it.
I'm the Sufi.
Fletch?
What?
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
Because we can't.
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
I have the same problem with my help.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Sure, all drifters do.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
Only if you promise not to return me.
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
Yeah.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
I'm sorry?
Cute thing.
What's he doing in Utah?
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
You can't do that.
I'm terrified.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
No wonder.
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
Jim Swarthout?
But I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
I'll do my best.
Have what?
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
I do it for love.
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
How'd you get this from her?
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
I came to warn you...
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
Hey, they blew me.
Let's get serious...
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
My axe!
This is boring, guys.
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
Who cares?  I got a case.
I tried to help you...!
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
You'd said something about proof...
I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
'Bye, Johnny...
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
Where do you want it?
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Are you sure it is dead?
Il est en retard.
There'll be someone else.
What?
I got no music!
There's nobody like that on six.
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
That's in France.
You want some eggs.
Why not?
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
Never trust a nigger.
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.
Policy man in Queens.
Give who a tail?
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
Yeah.
What happened to you?
What about Sal?
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
For garbage?
I been damn careful up to now.
What I know is what I told you.
Gotta be another way up, Frank.
You give him his drops?
I love you, Bud.
Wish you weren't.
I'm serious.
Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
Uh, huh.
Frank, please...
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
Where are you transmitting from?
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
Sorry 'bout that.
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
When?
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
Yeah, you betcha.
You all right?
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
John, he's got my driver's license.
In my pocket.
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
Dad, what the hell is going on?
John, you there?
John.  John, you all right?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Huh?
I better give you my address then.
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
So how'd you like LION KING?
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
I hear that.
Going?  How do you mean?
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
What was that?
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
I'm a slow eater.
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
Which one is it?
I don't know.
What?
What do you mean?
And, what about us?
You know him?
Why don't you help us?
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
Whaddya mean?
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
...And I said, shut up!
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
Uh...yes.  But...
So what are ya drawin'?
No.
Okay, give it back.
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
So where's Cort gone off to?
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
He didn't say anything?
What's goin' on?
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
Yes!
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
No, I --
Look, I don't want your money!
It's going.
Legs giving you trouble?
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
Maybe you should mind your own business.
That's very colorful, chief.
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
Well?
Oh, my dear God...
How many times do you want to hear this?
Until I hear the truth.
You don't know shit!
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
Never.
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
A major prick.
What are you going to do?
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
No thanks.
Right.
I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
I...I can't...
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
I...I don't know...
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
I opened thousands of brains.
What did you find?
Crosstown.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
Very dangerous.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
Do we care?
I think we Nought to wait.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
This could Pbe it.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
I talked to her two days ago.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
Because we're completely mismatched.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
All right. What's been going on?
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
Let's not start that again.
Where's your elastic brace?
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
Washed away.
Then they lost?
They're my team.
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
And the Father replies?
What's good?
And he has finer moments now and then.
Endearing.
Alla puttanesca.
I hear good things about the new play.
The fact is, I have to get going.
But you're his friend.
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
Everyone takes his turn.
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?
I'm sorry.
I thought you were a man of God.
What'd he say?
"Hell!"
It's beautiful.
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
You mean a general strike?
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
I dined at the prison.
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
From what budget?
It's about the Director.
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
Who died?
How long do you stay up there before you go?
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
How the hell did you get here.
Why have you done this?
You worried about the cost?
My medication.  I left it back there.
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
What's this, Lamar?
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
I can't do this.
--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
Not like <i>this</i> one.
What about them?
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
What do you add up to here?
We'll try again.
My license expired, let's get out of here.
Yeah.
I've been doing my homework.
What do you want for dinner?
Really?
Yeah... I know.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
You can't trust anything these days.
We got this far.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
Sounds good.
Yeah.
Where's home?
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Wire pull over?
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Then you do it.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
You do what he says, Harold.
When did you find out?
A couple of weeks back.
What's it got to do with you?
I know.
What?
I made a mistake.
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Jack?
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
He was all right to me.
I call that regular.
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
I work for him.
Yes. I met him last year.
Was he?
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
Is he coming here?
You've been watching the film.
The young girl. Who pulled her?
I don't know.
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Nice of you to come.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
No. It's all right.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
How's school?
Wilton Estate.
Did you work with him, Keith?
Why would it?
Don't know.
Where would I find him?
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
What about Keith?
You're a bastard.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
And that'll make me feel better?
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
Yep.
No? Funny that. Neither did I.
Nasty way to go.
Ask me?
...they hold on to their money...
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
It's too...
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
With River Oaks?
What?
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
What do you mean?
Yes...?
How?
Someone should rob the office.
Huh.
What could somebody get for them?
How do you know he'd buy them?
You haven't talked to him.
We're just "talking" about it.
Well.  Well...
You didn't?
What did you say?
What did he say?
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
Dave.
What if you don't get caught?
Why would I do it?
Me?
Absolutely.
That's ridiculous.
That's right.
You need money?  Is that the...
It is dead.
Everything I...you know...
He said he filed...
What.  What kind of outfit are we running where...where anyone...
To the cops?
Yes.  The cops.  No.
Where were you?
Was I?
Yes.
You have nothing to hide.
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?
...did they...
Oh, fuck.  Fuck.  FUCK FUCK FUCK!  WILLIAMSON!!! WILLIAMSON!!!  OPEN THE FUCKING...WILLIAMSON...
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
The people downtown said...
Mr. Levene...?
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look:  The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the...
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
Why?
Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. "Mur, this new kid burns my ass." "Shelly, he's out." You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once...
Because I say so.
You want something off the B list?
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
Mmm.
Yes, I am.
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
What?
No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
The check's no good?
Because I don't like you.
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
What?
Yeah.
Mmmm...
Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?
Monday.
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
You don't count Saturday.
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
Tuesday.
No.  She told me "right now."
She told me I have to.
What power?
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
Fuckin' asshole.
Why not?
Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
What is this, your farewell speech?
Your farewell to the troops?
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
I have the stuff from last year's...
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
I'm giving you three leads.  You...
Yes.
...Mr. Williamson...
Yes.
I saw him with you.
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
You're not my father!
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
Hey Mike, what can I say?
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
But if you're wrong...
Where's my brother?
They can come in now.
Mike, at three and a half...
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
No questions.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
Is he related to the witness?
Does it feel like a boy?
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
When do we talk?
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
He don't want to talk?
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
What makes you say that?
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
What's to be jealous of?
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
Sure.  I loved it.
I'm not a kid.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
What're you talking about?
Something I can do for you?
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
What have you done with him?
Good morning.
Mornin'.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me.
What?  Oh yes.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
Broke is more like it.
Football in college.
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
I don't like to talk about that.
I never thought you were.
But we have to match the other sketch.
Not fear.  More like disgust.
There's no people like you in my crowd.
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today.
Just go.  Please.  Why don't you go?
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
I don't hear anything.
Is that really her?
Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing?
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
You okay?
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
I didn't ask George to invite you.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
So what do I do?
More your line.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
You remember what the doctor tells us.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
He is not going to kill the old man?
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
Sure.
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
What rumors might those be?
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Just like going swimming, isn't it?
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
I was going to take a swim.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Sit?
Me, too. Every time I walk...
It's about my brother ... Kip...
What for?
I know you --
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
How's that?
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
Who is it -- ?
What for?
It's all microchips and shit ...
What color?
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
He's in some trouble ...
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -
You okay -- ?
Something like that -
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
I can handle it --
You?
Come here -
Where'd you find this one?
Sure, man --
You want me to buy her?
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
What for -- ?
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
Hey.
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
Let me worry about The Club ...
What are you doing... ?
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
Not really -
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
I don't want any more of that Shit.
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
Then you're safer in here.
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
Jimmy.
I gotta talk to you.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
How?
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
What kind of person doesn't call?
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
What? Come on!
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
I've been shit faced for like two weeks.
Thanks, Chuck.
Gone.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
You're kiddin' me.
Ah, history I think.
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
How much money you got?
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
Did your Uncle get arrested?
Why don't you beat off at your house?
What'd you say about me?
I have about seventy-three...
That's one aspect of what we do.
Seven.
--Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is three to the K times--
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Okay. How?
I can come back.
Yes.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
Find out what?
Yeah.
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
He married his cousin.
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
So I hear you're taking some time.
What happened?  You got fired, huh?
There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." We should'a kicked that dude's ass.
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
You've never been on a plane.
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
Don't give me you line of shit.
What?
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
I know.
Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
I'm Will.
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
Oh, you will?
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
How many?
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
Exactly.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
Want me to take a look?
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
Then what are you afraid of?
At least you have a mother.
Yes, I do, Will.
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself--
Ready, Ma?
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
Don't hold me so tight.
You're *ticklin' me!*
Lots must a died, too.
She's hotter'n a heifer.
What'd he look like again?
What's it to you?
So long.
Can all of you work?
House 25. Number's on the door.
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
*You* find out, I can't.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
Excuse me for asking.
He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
I ain't no more a preacher, you know.
How about us? Is that the truth for us?
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
I didn't mean nothing.
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
How 'bout Granma?
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
But will it--hurt the baby?
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
Make her easy, John. Watch her.
Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
How about it, Ma?
Don't taste bad.
Yes'm, that was it.
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
They know he got hit in the face.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
Yeah?
Which ones?
Tommy?
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
Gone--  --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.
But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
Are you crazy?
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
You do not.
--No.
We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
What am I gonna do?
What do you want to do?
I want to be an actor.
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
You see someone?
It's always the little things.
You met people.
Watched television?
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
Do you want to get a drink first?
Not the other way around...?
Is it something you've done?
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
Do you like the people you work with?
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
Okay.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
Hard to get good help these days.
No deal.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
Did you see Blank in there?
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
And they want me to make up for it.
They were very upset.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
You have a headache?
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
He sells BMW's?
He sold me this bad boy.
What the hell happened to you?
How's that?
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
I'm a professional killer.
Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
You lived in Chicago?
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
Shit.
Need a lift?
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
Is that your version of a pep talk?
I didn't know I had to.
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
Did he tell you that?
Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?
I'll take care of it.
Nothing.
Grace, I don't hate your father.
When? Tonight?
What?... Oh baby...
How's everything?
Who's there?
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
I'm sorry.
We're very lucky.
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
You've got to stop doing that?
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
She will if you think she should.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
Yeah, what?
No. I am a "tubab."
It's so cruel.
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
Sounds like something Tom would say.
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
Ha...
When you figure on branding?
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
I don't know if I can.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
I know where he goes.
You just showing off for her!
I can't believe it's the same horse.
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
Listen to this bullshit.  "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
Now that's cool.
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
What's that?
So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?
Right.
I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry.
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
Dead.
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
What's this one eat?
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
And you have to smile.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I know, I know who wrote it.
Yeah.
I can't believe they decided you won.
You know, I've been having these really weird..
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
Good.
Die, dickweeds!
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
Phreak?
What?
555-4202.
You're late.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
Okay sure. What about?
I don't know Brady.
Who's that?
Brady! Come with us.
Brady!
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
Honey, I don't think their home.
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
Like a real sister?
Sure it does.
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
Jamie, what happened?
Jamie!
What are you doing out here alone?
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
Hell of a night.
Where are you going?
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
He's been here.
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
Now you understand?
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
Look.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
I've already lost it.
Sure, see you later.
He can still watch.
What's the pumpkin for?
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
Fancy.
Get him out of here!
Yes.
Go get me a beer.
We're all alone, aren't we?
Will you call me tomorrow?
Yeah, sure.
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Well, she's totally not here.
Can we watch the monster movies?
Why are they under there?
What is it, Laurie?
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
What did he say?
...any sister talk?
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
Yeah.
Uh, who gets dropped first?
Yeah.
Oh!
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Uh...
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
Is this your first job?
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
Yes.
Yeah.
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
You--  Standards and Practices?
...with the affiliates.
Oh, my goodness!
Where are you headed?
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
Yeah.
What are you doing?!
I was looking for you.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
But not over me?
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
I care a great deal about him, yes.
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
I didn't say that.
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
Want some coffee or tea?
Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
Me?
Elliot lusts after you.
Because I have to!
No.
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
You're just realizing this now?
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
So how are you?
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
Oh, now-- 
Glad you could put in an appearance.
Ohh!
I know, I know.
That's really nice!
...you know?  I, uh...
This is the second opinion.
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
True.
What?  You're kidding!
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
He's such a loser!
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
No!
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
I was so bored!
I recall you.
Yeah.
Nobody ever said it.
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
You have.
Well, what about me?
Right.
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
A reward...
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
...they did it for a lark.
What's new onna street?
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
...nightmare.
...are they hard to get?
...sir...?
I've never heard that he...
Exactly.
...young boys, still...?
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
..suitcase...locker...
You seen John Brigham...?
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
I don't <u>think</u> so...
You nervous...?
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
If your duty requires it.
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
...your <u>scar</u>..?
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
Who does not?
I require...
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
...who say...?
And you let her get away.
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
I came to pay my...
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
You look lovely.
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
<u>Yes</u>.
The girl could use some help.
The girl needs help.
Why?
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
Fine, thank you, but
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
...my love...
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
Or clear your windshield with it.
I know it well.
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
What does <u>that</u> mean?
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
Yes.
...yes...?
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
No.
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am...
No, they're not from Wendy.
That would be a No.
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
What are you doing?
You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.
Yeah. And?
Man asswipe, you made my enormous cock fall off...
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--

Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...
Ah, our last night at camp...I always knew it would be something special.
God, you're beautiful.
Sorry Veronica.
I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.
Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice....
You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
No.
No way, no day!
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
Like a suicide thing?
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...
Cool off, we're seniors.
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
He's the manager!
I'm not hungry.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
You have it.
looks startled at the outburst.
Oh-what a nice outfit!
Fruit.
You'll never guess what's happened!!
I think I'm going crazy.
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
I understand, I think. Other women?
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
What?
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Bret. What the hell is going on?
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
You could say that.
Zero's a number right?
You win! Okay pull over.
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
In a word? Lucrative.
Two.
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?
Hey. Can I borrow something?
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
It was you!  I thought I heard...
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Mister LaPlante...
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened.  What happened is...
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
I snuck in.
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?
Uh, no.
There, like that.  Kind of, uh, sexy.  You can support me anytime, John.
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
You didn't... get it on with him?
Reporters don't have hormones?
How are they with kids?
So this really does the trick, eh?
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?
Where are these toys of yours?
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
About what?
About us.
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
I'm thirsty.
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
And?
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
But it's what we want.
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
And it's a shorter commute.
How long does it have to be a new house?
Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same idea.  Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time.
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
I'm having the floor fixed,
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
What for, dickweed?
Do you see a man?
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
What?
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
No.
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
That is what bothers me.
I'm sure they will.
Yes.
What worries you?
I would like to say goodbye.
The past?
Then take me with you.
Why are you doing this?
You got me.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
I'm just trying to place you.
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
Must you fight him?
Be careful, Conner.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
Why?
How could they get by him?
What's that next to him?
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
That's what the Kurgan said.
It will not end tonight.
It isn't over, is it, Conner?
Is there anything else you need?
What'd you find out?
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
You get anything on Smith?
What do you want to do?
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
I understand.
Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
Jen?  Are you all right?
<u>Get on the floor</u>!
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
Jesus.  What is this?
We're fucked.
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
Then we might as well die rich.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
Okay.
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
He needs a doctor.
We can take it with us.
The cops are comin'!
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
I don't know.
What hospital?
How did you get this number?
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
Mine, too.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
Shh, they'll hear you!
What do you want?
Thanks for the shirt.
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
Do it.
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
I want to know what in hell you're doing.
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
Special Agent Jones.
Not until the man calls.
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
Can you open them?
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
Who is it?
Are the disks still in your room?
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
You want to pay me?
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Yes we have.
They fired a rocket at us.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
The police are very busy.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
Where are they going?
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
I am on a list! What list?
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
When will they be here?
Get out of this room and get back to work.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
Excuse me.
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
Your brother's here?
Let's have dinner first.
The president has been murdered.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
What is it, Paul.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
They are being evacuated.
I have a confession. When we met...
Tell me what it was.
What does it matter.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
What do we do with all these people?
Where has all our beer gone?
Paul. Are you alright?
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
Can I help you?
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
Don't think it'll be a problem.
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
If you know where it is, get there!
Pritchett, is that you?
Why?
How you gonna manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome?
Price!!
Don't think it's even an issue.
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
You think this is fucking funny??
What?
Fascinated.
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
He must've unsealed the room!
It looks delicious...
What do these ingredients mean?
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Where is she now?
Sure.  Did you see the others?
What's he doing daddy?
Why?
I can't move!
What's the matter?
Are you playing tricks on me?
Were you fooling with the power?
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
We're not going.
Are you all right?
What do you mean, unfortunately?
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.
This isn't happening...
The rain is letting up.
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
And what is ... this frozen moment?
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
What?
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
And he still sits there?
Sure.  Why?
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
I don't know.  Maybe.
Thank you.
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
Yeah really.  I'm ...
Really?
You got about five minutes and change.
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star."
We're going in from the ground floor.
That was close....
I'm a ghost.  Boo.
Did he mention the Mayflowers?
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
A little petting is not the issue!
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
Good job, not pretty, but good.
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
Yes.
What else do you got under there ... I don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame.
Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
Hungry, anyway.
Oh, no, really, I --
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
...Certain people are --
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
Norville!
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
I can't print this!
Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
Ya know, entry level!
Tell me about it.
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
My pleasure, sir.
But, buddy, you were --
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
And Sid says you stole it!
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
Well, I'm a college graduate --
You're fired.
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
There's one in every story.
Maybe he's wise.
...Her mother needs an operation...
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
I wish I hadn't heard --
That doesn't sound like him.
No, Wes.
And charming?
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
Well, Jeffries, why come to us about it?  Why don't you go up to the Houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble.
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
We're all in it.  There won't be a shred of pride or decency left for any of use.  Say something, Paul!  You've always been good with words.  Put some together, now, and tell us that you're not responsible -- that every damnable bit of it doesn't rest squarely on your shoulders!
Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
You want to go?
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
The turkey in?
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
Don't start.
This just isn't the best moment for this.
I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --
I'm fine dad.
About?
Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
A prior engagement overcame me.
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
Good shit.
A key party?
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
Who?
Please don't.
I'm thinking of going back to school.
Educated guess.
Now you are being rude.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
Arise and shine, young Hood.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
Am I right or am I right?
Just be careful.
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
My what?
How do you know this shit?
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
Want some gum?
I don't know.
Wow!
How are the parental units functioning these days?
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
The ones you built?
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
Huh?
Just after Leland Street.
So far.
What's the D.A. got them on?
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
This murder was in the papers, right?
She your only sibling?
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
No.
So?
Randy Stetz?
Eight years.
To do nothing.
No way.
I wish I could stick it out like you.  I just, with Trish and the kids...
You want me to take you somewhere?
No...
She used some stupid code name.
Yes.
Where's your back-up?
Wild card.
Monstrous.
We had feared we were the only ones...
Ah! You have questions?
What are we?
Who made us what we are?
Then there is nothing.
And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
Yes... My God...
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
Your melancholy eyes...
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
Is that supposed to frighten me?
Don't Louis --
We're immortal. You've always known that.
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
You both did it?
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
And you never cried -
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
Or her, or her - or any of them?
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
That's not so.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
What do you want from me?
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
I can't do it.
You're sure?
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
What are you saying?
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
That's all past, Lestat.
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
You're not lying to me, are you?
Yes.
You said the slave had a crucifix...
The story about stakes through the heart?
Lestat escaped the fire!
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
It's over, I'm telling you...
Wait...Did you say off-season?
What about a radio?
I want off this island.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
There's nothing between Will and me.
The number's unlisted...
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
Yes.
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
No, you're not.
Julie! Wait! You okay?
It was one year ago...
Deep breaths --
You sure it's okay with you?
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
Jeez, that's a full carat --
What's the matter, boy trouble?
Cool.
And so could you -- crazy fool.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
What is up with that weirdo?
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
You're just talking nonsense.
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Where's Thea?
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
You are fortunate in your father.
But one must love a father.
Miss Wollsten!
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect ——young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
You wouldn't tell that ——
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
Theodosia.
Hero?
You are my friend.
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
He hates all my race.
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?
Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
Carter –– bank examiner.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
Oh, well, I can't . . .
She's . . .
Where? I don't see a thing.
A boy?
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star –– made second team All American.
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Of course it's the place.
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
Mother . . .
When'd you see him last?
Today, over at the house.
Want to give my flower a drink.
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we're going to drive on down to Florida.
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
No.
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Yes –– charge.
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
Well, no younger than I was.
Maybe you were born older, George.
How's that?
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
Do me a favor, will you, George?
What's that?
What gives?
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
I know, but . . .
Some other time, George.
Hello.
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .
Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
Well, I don't.
Me?
Well, why don't you say it?
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
Uh-huh.
Ouch!
How's that?
Where'd you get that dress?
Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.
Why not?
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
Let's just go sailing, okay?
You coming up on him?
Sean!   Catch the rope!
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
Chief?
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.
Mike's out there.
You're too close.  Back off.
I'm going out there.
Do I have to?
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Mike?  Is that you?
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....
It came up during the meeting.
Is that what it is?
There is nothing to discuss.
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
We don't know that, do we?
Is there one in these waters?
Probably.
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
Door's locked.
Oww!
Are you going to be able to sleep?
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
Martin, it could be anything.
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
Dad!  Dad!
It killed her.  It ate her.
How old is your cousin?
Waiting for Andy.
Who'd you ask?
No class.
By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out.  More, with this wind.
Next week.
What about the others?
Hurry, please.
What is it?
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
They're turning around.
Yeah.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
Go on, you're tired.
What you're saying is we have a Great White shark in the lagoon.
It's Miller time!
Yeah.  Down there.
That macho pompous English --
Not enough loving.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
You would, wouldn't you?  I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.
You all right?
Don't think about it.  It's over.
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
I can use a shot of what he's got.
Finally.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
... He ought to put him in here.
It's too soon to move him.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
I want that shark, Kathryn.
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
Nobody told me.
I can have them walk backwards.
No, no.  That won't do.
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
Why?
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
Philip.
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
How long you staying?
How come?
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
Yes, it's great!
It's okay, Sean.
The space shuttle has landed!
Buzz off.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Oh...
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
It's not closing, Mike.
How'd you do in school?
Something wrong?
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
Sure.
That bugger moves fast.
Daddy, why can't I...?
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
Where are you going?
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
What the hell are we arguing about?
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
I can't help it....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together.  What are you going to do now?
I hope the man knows what he's doing....
Stop that....
You check it....
Don't be late.
What?
You're damn right I'm serious....
I don't want to talk about that.
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
It was no accident....
Sure you can....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
No, you're not....
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
You're not going to bet it all....
I have two right feet.
I have my own little island.
I tried winter once.  Burlington, Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy....
You're always taking time off....
Why?
I tried to tell you...I tried....
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
Keep it steady....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
I wish there was something I could do....
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
What happened to Clarence and...?
We don't write up anything until we're done....
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
How come only me?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
Holy Christ....
All the time....
It'll work....
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
When he has a pillow over his head....
Where's Lenny?
I'll take care of it.
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
Did you bring it with you?
The <u>dogs</u>?
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
What time is it?
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
What do you mean?
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
Because I dislike her too much ..
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
I haven't got it.
Why?
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
What exactly you doing, John?
I guess by the bed.
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
No.
No, Sir.
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
What are you looking for?
Vehicle references.
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
Can I see your hands?
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
Are you married?
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
Have you known her long?
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
I don't want them to arrest you.
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
You find something curious in that?
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
Well, thanks.
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
That took guts.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
Well.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Same to you.
Sure you're okay to drive this?
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
That's the girl I love.
No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
I'll give it everything.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
I understand your anxiety.
No, I air-dry.
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
No, I don't know.
No.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
I don't want to be friends anymore.
Don't be silly.
I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
You okay?
You wanted smaller.
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
Let's go the zoo.
ERRR-IIIC!
Do you think it goes all the way across?
He says it's a bad idea!
Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
That one time was just the bumper.
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that’s where he's headed.
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
I thought you were an expert.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
NO!
He used to know me.
You remember the sounds they made?
You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books.
When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.
Yeah.
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
It doesn't matter what I think.
I don't believe you.
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
How could you possibly?
You've broken its leg!
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
-- way we could safely --
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
How many lines of code are there?
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
The movement!
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
It's anti-nature.

Hola, Juanito
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
Why not?
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
Are they heavy?
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
No.
It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
Why?
We gotta do something.
What?  What can we do?
Oh, I hate the other kind.
Let's go!
What works?
Don't do that!
Your silence intrigues me.
No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the monsters come over here!
You want to put in chain saws?
That's not true...
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
What?
What happened?
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
Who's chest?
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
Are you going to plead insanity?
Sorry.
"Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave."
Well?
Oh?
None of that's true?
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
Oh?
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
How do we prove it?
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
Not yet.
You know how to use one of those?
-- Merely in the interests of order.
I read the one about the penal colony.
You work in the cemetery.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
I gave it to him yesterday.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
Well, I --
-- Eduard --
I do.
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
Tonight?
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
I -- I found your jailer.
No -- not this time.
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
Probably not.
... A piece of paper ...
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
I could always apply there.
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast!
Father!
There's a light up ahead.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Give it back!
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
Are you gonna start it up?
Why?
Why? She's a junkie.
Didn't want you.
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
-- Yes.
Could I ask some questions?
Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --
How would I remember?
What? This?
No.
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
I don't see anything, do you?
No, I said what did you think.
Arlyn Page.
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
The same as Jane McKenna.
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
Bree --
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
Mm.
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
How is it back there?
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
What?
Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
Two years ago? Sorry.
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
You forgot the milk.
You get a new fence.
Salisbury steak.
I think I'm going to throw up.
Then eat around it.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Objection!
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness.
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
No.
I don't recall.
Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Jesus Christ.  That's a real blockbuster.  I always figured you guys had it made.
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
And?
Yeah?
I know....I know.
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
Oh, no..
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
How many?
Mr. Kramer, there's--
What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
He's okay...Thel, can I ask you a favor?
What?
Here. We'll collect them.
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
I will not approve it.
He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
I am afraid.
In the Pacific Ocean.
It is an island. American territory.
Where is Alsace?
What can I do? I am only a boy.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
Britain chooses not to.
Where is that?
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
Is that true or pretend?
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
We cannot.
No.
Like my mother.
Go!!!
I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
What the hell are you doing?!!
A spring trap!
Promise you won't kill me, first.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
How big do the bears get?
Oh my God.
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
Who?
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
You flew up here because your boss--
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
Hector!!
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
Now I'm gonna puke.
This... how long did this attack go on for?
Yes.
What?
Was he swallowed?
Hey!!
You like Jack?
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Kelly.
It's ten after nine.
This is what we do?
I'm not even a field person.
<u>You</u>?
Backstabber?
Liar?
Myra.
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
I understand.
Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
What do you see, Starling?
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
What would it take?
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
Yes.
It's much better than your shoes.
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
No, I came because we need -
Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
Reasonably so. Yes.
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Ahhh... Why?
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
They all were.
Go, Doctor.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
A cattle ranch?
Why so briefly?
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
Thank you, Clarice.
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
Much further?
Because what I am interested in is right here...
Will you go back to England?
When? How?
And by sea!
"Some"?
Yes. Go ahead.
He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
How long?
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
What a place for them...
Sir!
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
Granted.
My colors?
Qui vive?
France.
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
Not exactly a big ocean country.
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
That's an order!
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
What can we do?
Something wrong, Cobb?
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
I'm going inside.
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
Forty-eight hours!
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
Typhoon?!
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
What is it?
Are you sure you saw something?
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
Bitch!  Look what you did!
What's wrong, did you miss me?
How much did you part with?
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.
Yes?
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.
There are no others.
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
How long has he been in there, son?
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
Jesus, I have heard about him.
We gotta get those guns.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
That's it all done, we are off.
What do you mean?
Why, what's up?
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
Tom?
You will what?
It's pay day, ain't it?
I wanted to talk to you about that.
Do you want me to draw a picture?
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
I can't help you, Plank.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
Doesn't sound very good to me.
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
So?
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
Where did you get those from, a museum?
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
How many feet?
What are you carrying, Willy?
Er, fertilizer.
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
They're not going to jail.
Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army?
Yes, sir--
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
Do whatever they tell you--
I'm feeling okay--
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
I'm not picking it up.
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
No. You?
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
Come on in--
You've been in this house for a while?
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
They were in the Army. Like your father.
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
Seriously.
Treasure hunter?
Pleased to meet you.
If the next guy's a redneck.
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
This is an official visit, then--
Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
Es muy lindo, su coche--
Quien es? [Who is it?]
This girl is a friend of yours?
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
That so?
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
He still living?
Morning, Hollis.
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
Mami, how old were you when my father--
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
And my father?
I don't think you can take it personally--
Mom?
It's Saturday.
Field trip?
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
Most people did, yeah.
Yeah.
You don't want to be Sheriff.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
What was your father's name?
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
We start from scratch--
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
I didn't want to be going around your back.
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
You sell much out here?
Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
Another woman?
You going to tell her?
He's gonna find out.
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
Mister D'Amour?
How much?
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
That's Butterfield...
Take a look at this.
Maybe they're not tricks.
D'Amour.
Will you come to him on your knees?
Are they treating you okay?
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
He taught all this to Swann?
So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
No.
You said you weren't with him for love.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
Yes.
Harry?
Don't look.
What the fuck?
Valentin?
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
Are you finished with me?
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
Trickery and divinity.
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
Oh, I've got plenty.
It's one in the afternoon.
Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
Philip Swann?
Are you a gambling man?
Probably.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Yes.  It's regrettable
Yes.
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
At birth.  I don't know you --
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
I only wear ties for funerals.
Look, Ma, no wires.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
So Nix won't come looking for her?
No.
He's better off this way.
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
You didn't try hard enough.
I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
Yes.
Bob, it's me.
Hi again, how's it going?
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
I'm here for the week.
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
I don't want to go home.
It's Charlotte.
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
Really?
How old is she?
Where's your husband?
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Oh?
You know, eat healthier.
Fine.
Fine. Is it going ok?
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
Yeah.
I guess she's busy.
Excuse me?
Hello, can I have room 5601.
Evelyn Waugh?
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
I miss you.
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
Oh no...
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?
What're these?
I found them in your file box.
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
What a...jerk!
Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
And how would you describe him?
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
Is he going to be okay?
I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
You fucking bastard.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
You okay?
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
There's nothing else here.
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
Maya?  What do you mean?
A lot of good that'll do.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
You know what?  You can go.
Get out of here.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
I plan to.  You want a tip?
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
What's this?
What's the matter with you?
What happened?
What?
Need any help?
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
Are you okay?
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
So you're still breast-feeding?
He's fine.
Can I take your coat?
Careful.
You could make a career by telling me where.
I found you someone.
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
I know.
So how come you could play basketball?
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
For how long?
I know this.  What do you want?
So she's honest.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
God, here we go.
See you made it.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
I won.
Sorry about your game.
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
You want to go talk?
Hey.
Hey, what's up.
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
Never had to.
What?
Few days ago.
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
You visiting?
Maybe go back to school.
I'll play you.
Hey, girl.
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
With who?
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
We still have to go?
Guess he talked to you.
What people?
You know, people.
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
What mess?
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
And some things should never fucking happen!
I ain't a damn liar.
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
After five years.
I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
No need for braces, Donnie.
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Hello?
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
What kind of Cancer?
Oh, she's fine.
What the fuck do you want?
Don't sit down.
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
...Hello...?
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
Did you hear what I said?
Yeah, but I don't know --
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
No.
You take cream or sugar?
Yeah.
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
What's that stand for?
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
Eight o'clock?
Great, bye.
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
No, no.
Let's make a deal.
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
I'm sorry.
Well.
You live alone?
Claudia.
-- can I get you?
What?
I should maybe go to the bathroom.
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
What's up?
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there?
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
....do you know who I am?
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
How's today then?
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
Do me a personal favor --
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
All it takes is one second?
So boring, so useless --
In aid of what?
Not really.
And that's what you've heard?
Time's up.  Thank you for the interview.
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
Psychology major?
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
"Frank" was my mother's father.
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
About three weeks ago.
Uh. huh.
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:
You're just come in --
Are you lyin' to me?
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
All your other fluzzies?
Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
Are you ok?
I'm drinking.
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
Did you tell her?
How do we do this, then?
That's it.
Just once.
Well maybe.
Jimmy, did you touch her?
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
I don't know what I've done.
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
She's asleep.
Yes.  What's your name?
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
I can't.
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
Shut the fuck up.
I'm trying to help, Linda --
Let me call you a car, Linda.
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
I need this one.
Be ready at two --
C'mon, man.
Yes.
Alright.
..sorry...
....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?
It's raining frogs from the sky.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
No, M'lady.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
What had you to do with this, Mother?
D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate.
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
What do you propose to do?
You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
So what has changed?
Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.
Pull them back!
Everyone back.
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
Mother of God!
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
But why?
Coming?
Who?
Who does?
"Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."
It worked!
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
Who came?
Your Majesty has had many women --
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
I was told this impostor was dead!
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Where is Michelle?
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
You dead yet?
Yes, yes, go on.
Sire!  I -- How did you --
Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
Captain Doyle?
It's Marvosa -
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
What?  Wait a minute -
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
I had it all on tape...
Tubbs, it's me.
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
You must be going somewhere.
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
Are you a regular there?
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
That was Peterson upstairs.
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
In thirty-five minutes.
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
Who did he ask for?
How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
Get me a plane!
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
Something Lecktor said.
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
It does, doesn't it?
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
Not yet.
How did you come to Gateway?
No. Reba...?
Who is it?
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Do you see?
'No' what?
It's Will Graham...
She'll be in, in the morning...
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
I understand he cut you pretty good...
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
No.
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
Tell me about yourself.
Blue, then.
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
What's that?
Thanks for the lift.
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Meet point's up ahead!
Will it keep them out?
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
Are you gonna kill him?
Stuart is fine.
I thought you would have some ideas.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
I want your opinion.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
Pretty well.
Yes.
You got it.
Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!
And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
Tony Clifton.
Maybe I should talk to the natives.  Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba --
Andy!
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
Then your father's a wimp.
Give me the book.
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
Excuse me, Andy...
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him.
Why...?  Andy, why...?
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
I saw Michael!
What's in Memphis?
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
A -- a tourist.
We'll need a search running.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
That's the third white van I've seen.
What?!
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
Sorry.
Why you're here?
Operator.
Yes.
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
What are you doing?
Why do my eyes hurt?
How?
Set down in there.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
How is he?
You're the Oracle?
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
Neo, please, you have to trust me.
Why?
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
What is it?
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
No one has ever done anything like this.
See who?
What are they doing to him?
How?
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
Cypher, I thought --
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
What are your plans?
Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.
See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
'And with your spirit.'
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
'Thou art then a king?'
She don't look Jewish.
You flew before?
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
What happened to you Flash?
Don't come any closer!!!
Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
No.
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
OK, ok...
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
Oh Michael, look...
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
How much was the original loan again?
Charlie, this is business.
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
No.
A paper on that one too?
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
The girls like it loud.
Don't count it...it's all there.
Sal!... fourteen street.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
What, honey?
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
From the Korean War.
What is this?
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
...This shit's not bad.
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
Yes, sir?
We have an arrangement now.
What an odd pairing.
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
A voice?
What'd it say?
It's going to be great --
As close as a deal could be.
What do you mean?
For how long?  And why?
Mind if I throw up?
Whose?
Yours.
Don't you want to hear the details?
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
And what do I get?
Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
'It's up to Joe'?
He said that?
I from dat nex' place.
No, no.  I on holiday.
Yes.
You loved back?
Good morning, Jennifer.
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
You love Allison, don't you?
Come again?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
Yes --?
Then why are you here, Joe?
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
Excuse me?
Girlfriend?
Almost.
Yes?
You're here?
'Love will find out the way'.
-- Yes?
'Threw' you?  Where?
No.
Not at all.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Good morning, Bill.
Yes?
What do you mean?
Make an exception?
That's what everybody says.
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
Why didn't you stop me?
I'll be the judge of that.
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
Yeah.
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
Then what is it?
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
I don't expect you to.
And we're very grateful.
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
I don't!
It's enough now.
'The one' to do what?
Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
The 'question' --
Hi, Bill --
How's that, Quince?
You think Drew will go for it?
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
Eddie?
Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
We're all here, Bill --
Good morning, Dad.
Drew's aboard?
Do you love Drew?
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Uh oh --
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
Thank God.
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
What a night.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
Nothing lasts.
I could be her.
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
No, it was so right it scares me.
21.
78.
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
I don't want blood on them.
Take the money and walk away!
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
It's isolated.
Don't remember.
Your wife?
It's not easy to be calm when -
What do the police think?
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
Yeah?
Calls himself Dodd.
You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
What?
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
My wife.
Sweet.
You tell me.
How can you read that again?
It's good.
Yup?
Mr Gammell?
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
We've got to get him out of here.
So what are you gonna do now?
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
This is a drug deal?!
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
It makes all the difference.					 *
Why do you keep lying to me?					 *
Bullshit.							*
What was it for?							   *
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
Lemon or lime?
Doing...?
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
Just came in.  She's still alive.
You need to consider a few issues.
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
Okay.  You got the "item"?
Two main players plus three.
I thought we had to meet the Man.
That's right.
Is it December?
Zero risk.
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
Hola, chica.
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
If they attack you...
What's our deal?
Stevens?
Where we meeting 'em...?
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
Go ahead.
Detective Crockett.
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
Okay.  What's up?
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
From whom...?
Yeah...?
On the phone.
Alonzo...!
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
Yeah.
Okay.
Define small.
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
What...?
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
Shee-it...  Kee-rist, you really know the ropes. Wish to hell I bumped into you before. I'm Joe Buck from Texas and I'm gonna buy you a drink, what do you say to that?
... you see what I'm getting at here? She got a penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money!
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
Tell her, Ratso.
Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
Hey, what the hell you doing?
Listen, I gotta have money.
Ready for anything.
Get down -- where?
Tunnel?
Who?
Shit.
Yeah. How's Mom?
Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.
Sure.
Those mountains? are they?
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.
What's your father do?
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
And?
Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody.
I want to cut his throat.
What?
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
What'd the Prosecutor say?
What lawyer?
Peter...
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Oh, man, there you go again.
You feel anything?
Can we get this car there?
My God, what the hell are you...?
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
Don't.
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
C'mon...
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
What?
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
This wing configuration. I've never...
Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
You want to read it?
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
I can take it, go ahead.
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
Yeah, thanks.
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
Annie, what's the matter?
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
What about a bee...?
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
A toast?
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
You don't know?
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
What?
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
Marcia, please.
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
That'd be a first.
Great.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
What are you talking about?
An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
It is, Billy.
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
And the check's in the mall.
What if I pay the rent?
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
Damn, you're beautiful.
There's nearly 2 million in London.
And six billion in the world.
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
I don't.
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
Where do I meet you?
How do you suggest I go about it?
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
What did you think you were doing!
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
No.  Should I?
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor..
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
..I'm fine..and you?
Now how to get in there.
Luther, say again.
By asking me.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
That's S.O.P..
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
Nothing but civilians, Gene.
This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like.
Satisfied?
All ten million.
Krieger can get it.  Right?
Did we get it?
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
What happened to Jim?
You didn't have to.........
Is this the only way?
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
What kind?
I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
What makes you trust me?
About what?
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
Why, may I ask?
That's the question I want to ask Job.
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
What was your deal with Job?
How will you make sure Job will be there?
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
You're not going to any meeting without me.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
I thought I'd take some now.
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
Where are you?
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
Yeah.
Whatís going to make him do that?
Jim...?
I usually am.
Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
Jack you're so wicked.
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
Uh-huh
What?
Yes.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
He's in Palermo.
I'm going to marry him.
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
How'd he die?
Fast.
When you get engaged?
It's so bright.
Take it easy.
But he wants me to come!
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
Kinda gaudy.
Awful?
You're late!
Yeah.
Let me go home.
He's coming.
Bye, Aunt Rita.
You don't want the fish.
You never have dessert.
Will you marry me?
What do you mean?
This is a good suit.
I like this ring.
Seven-thirty.
Alright. A month. In a month.
A month from today?
I have no secrets from my family.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
Where you been?
Your hair's different.
Where's pop?
What? He's in Sicily!
Did you see it?
That's it! That's the reason!
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
Yes?
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
Will you join me for dinner?
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
That's my house.
My God, it's a mansion!
It's a house.
Cosmo.
I don't know.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
Through ... We found them.
Am I right?
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
King of the WHO?
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
NI!
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
Come on then.
Look!
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
Now what happens?
They're nervous, sire.
What?
We shall attack at once.
By what name are you known?
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
Yes, I see.
Be quiet!
Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
Sorry ...
Exactly.  So... logically ...
He will be soon. He's very ill.
To seek the Grail!
Who's that then?
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
Herbert.
But I don't like her.
How?
Leaving the room.
Er ... if ... we ... er ...
Until you, or anyone else ...
Right.
Oh ... hello ...
Quick!
We must examine you.
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
I speak as I find, Archie.
Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
You've got three broken ribs, man!
The place is a mess.
It's what the maids are for.
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
Of course.
I see.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
It is quite late enough.
Mama...
Checked and locked, sir.
I need a man who knows where I am.
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
No.
Is that the Queen's request?
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
What brings you here?
Dare say you can be taught.
No loyalty.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
She'll think I betrayed her.
Mr Brown.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
Those, over there, there.
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
That doesn't make him an expert.
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
Must they always follow us?
I was told you were in a fight.
Have I ever let you down before--?
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
This is my good John Brown.
Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
Who told them that?
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
Ma'am?
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
He is sick, ma'am.
Then why are you not with him?
What do you mean?
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
Maybe he's not dead.
He?
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
So how did it know my name, then?
No way.
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
The Police, then...
Which way do you think Level Two is?
Okay.  It's West.
I know.
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
It's here!!!
I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
So what do you think?
This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
What did you say?
I'm going home Cynthia.
What do you mean "you know"?
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
It's been a very strange day.
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
One.
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
Yes...what is it?
How...  how'd they know I was here?
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
No, I don't.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
Yes.
No. I can't.
I think I've been hurt.
I'm all right.
Good luck!
Don't stop!
It's kind of embarrassing but,
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Yeah, they showed me
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Hardly.
Not here...no thanks.
Where are we ?
What about Matt ?
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt.
So what do we do ?
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
We drown.
Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
Do you have something better to talk about ?
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years.
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
Where are we going ?
Yeah a real shame.
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
What the fuck are you talking about.
Knock yourself out.
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
Not yet.
But, he's...
Hand me the 3/8ths.
You did.
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Well ?
Yes sir.
That was rather.... disappointing.
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
Is it as good as I hope it is ?
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
What happened ?
How can this happen ?
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
Yes.
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !
Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
Excuse me I asked you a question.
How did you know my name?
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
Well you know what I mean.
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
I already bought a ticket.
Yeah.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
Oh.  Ohhh?
What're you saying?
Sure am, who are you?
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
Do you have any pictures if her?
She's beautiful.
See you? He can smell you from there.
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
I guess you have.
Don't wake up Vada.
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
Getting off please.
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.
I'd never do that.
You ratted on my mother??
Boy, you're really into this.
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
Just give it to me!!
What are you doing? You can't go in there!
My mother stood on this very spot.
What do you think?
And you'd be my cousin?
But we wouldn't really be related right?
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...

I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
What's it for?
Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.
You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
Maybe.
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
Then you'll be all set.
There's plenty of fruit.
Bye Aunt Rose.
I was commenting on your hair.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
Danny?
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
Keep your voice down!
You are perfectly healthy.
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
No.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
They're dead?
Yes they are.
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
Are you mad at me?
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Pointing upwards Look...
Did you ahh, love him?
Perfect.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
I love this guy! 
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Why?
I'm very nervous.
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
What do you get for that?
I paid the money.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
She's shy.
Who's winning?
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
What are they about?
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
Uh huh, why?
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
Hey look at this, no feet!
It doesn't work, it always stays black. 
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
You could pick that scab on your arm.
Hey look at this!
No, I don't wanna.
What?
Heaven.
Don't DO that!!
Can we go yet?
But I have my clothes on!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
Well when you get older, you just have to.
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
Okay, okay.
Umm, Ummmmm
I should look different.
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
I have a suggestion...
Go figure you.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
And the answer was so simple.
Exactly.
Don't you see...
Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
Is anybody watching?
Maybe.  I should call Ben.
Well, you're a little early...
I've been calling for days!
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
Hate that.
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
Every day.  She makes the bed.
Quite the little eccentric.
Waiter! Check, please!
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
Michael...
I asked you...
Does that make it right...
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
Uh.  I saw that moving...
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
And to m...
Maybe it's happy there.
Grand Old Opera --
I hate that music.
I won first prize.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
Am I disturbing you?
You bet.
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
He has that sign with the tree.
That's what he wants.
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
How much?
Okay.
Howdy.
Where are you going?
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
Not yet.
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Your brother?
HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.
Mr. Green?
She sure sings nice.
Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.
What did you say?
No.
No.
We don't mess with accessories.
Parts.
What year?
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
I don't think so.
How long have you been with them?
Who is this?
Who is thin?
Who is this?  It's Tom.
Wow!
I've got a gig tonight.
I have to go.
How old are you?
That's unkind.
I was in prison for twenty-eight years.
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
Sorry I'm late.
Sleeping.
I mean...
You always live there?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
Got me an audition tonight.
More or less.
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
What was the color of Tim's belt?
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Yeah.
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Who is we?
Thank you, sir.
Lobotomy Bay?
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
On average forty million.
Hypnotizing.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
That's my opinion.
Roger, no.
Wayne Gayle.
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
Rollin'...and speed!
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Where' you goin'?
Boy - you hear me?!
Where was that?
She done moved to Detroit.
Thanks.
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.
No. I'm new in town.
Yes, aren't you?
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
How d'you mean?
But I would like to see you again.
What's he like?
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
What about him?
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
Don't deny me, Duff.
We can always do that, Duff.
Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
Where' you goin'?
Like what?
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
How about a drink?
I said, I come to town with a girl.
She don't look no worse to me.
I said, she's in great shape.
No thanks, Lee.
Sure.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
Guess it's never been easy.
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
Hi.
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
He's your son.
Omar, listen to me--
Easy...
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
What are you talking about?
Prepping your trip.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
I saw your girl yesterday.
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Right...
How are we doing?
Can you take me to it?
Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.
You can make your move when it comes after me.
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
Why would you want me to kill you?
I think you're full of shit.
Couple of months.
How soon is soon enough?
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
A regular Fagan.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
I'll be okay.
Something exotic I hope.
Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
...And if I guess wrong?
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
How long will they watch us for?
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
Well excuse me.
Guess who I did it with last night...
Anita!
Senorita Josie.
Bridgework?
Hi!
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
He is totally crunching on you.
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
That's your story!
He's my teacher!
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
Are mom and dad here?
Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
Yes, desperately.
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
I know.
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
Why?
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Wow - I-
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
If you went away, what would become of me?
Why not?
Uh-huh.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
Where are you going?
It's not the gas, Dad!
Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Oh, please...
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
Wanna join your little friend?
You got a problem with me, Grady?
You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?
What is it?
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?
All of them.
I'm sure you would.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
Research.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
Horseshit.
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.
What?
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
Well, if it isn't my little girl... come to visit her Daddy.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
Call me Nancy.
Must have opened while I was away at school.
So do I.
You sound like Peter Pan.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
Mary Helena.
Cooling down.
What did you think?
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
I won't allow it.
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
No!
I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
Okay.
Whoopsidaisies.
She left me.
I'm sorry.
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
I have thought about you.
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
My son's name is Johnny?
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
You've got big feet.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
That's spectacularly unfair.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
Thank you.  Shall I...
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
No.  Not true...
He's cooking guinea fowl?
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Is this your first film?
Blimey.  What's that?
Well, thanks, that's great.
Still, not sparkling.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
I suppose so.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
No, sir.
Does she know you're coming?
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
Yes.
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
Yes.
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
Fabulous.
We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
So do I!
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
H-H-Hearts.
B-B-Billy.
What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
C-C-C-C-Candy!
In there.
Let me get on your shoulders.
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
What?
A pecking party?
Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
I said out!
Just wait till you hear...
What's this?
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
I see...
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
How are you feeling?
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
When?
Time out!
Are you a doctor?
What's troubling ya, buddy?
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
Oh, yeah?
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
Hey, how ya doin'?
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
That!
Well, Miss... I would say... I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.
He is your husband, no?
You ask what room he's in, okay?
No.
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
Good.
Oh no.  Do you?
Dwayne?
A very large pig.
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
Why are you asking me this?
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
Mickey Spillane.
Hi, Peter.
Hey--
Why are you doing this?
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
Is something the matter?
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
You're Damon Bradley?
Sure.
I don't believe in statistics.
You don't have any idea?
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
I just got a dial tone--
What'd you find?
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
What?
No.  No, you go ahead.
Joan Collins stayed here.
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
Yes.  He is.
So...
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
Kate.
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
Mania.
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that— he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
Working hard?
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
Don't say that!
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
Hello, Edie.
They play pretty rough.
Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to the old rummies.  Did you know him very well?
You training to be a nun or something?
In braids? That's right.
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
I only live up there and across the roof.
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
That was nice of you.
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
How do you like it?
And when things get in your way— or people —you just knock them aside— get rid of Them— is that your idea?
It's true.
I— I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
That—  —word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
He's going to have to grow up too.
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
Now don't give me a hard time.
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
Baseball bats— that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?
Better.
Yeah— us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
Give me a double.
Take it easy now, Terry.
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
Forty-five bills.
Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.
Aw, Johnny... .
Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Yeah, yeah— Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.
I can't believe it— a small fortune.   You can't buy me— you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
What are you down here for— to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
Something's making that music.
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
I'm not sure...
She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!
There are others.
Then cancel my order.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
Then why do you shake so?
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
Yes, it is.
I want to speak with you, please.
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
He called the day he escaped.
Do we need him?
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
Just that she got away.
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
Let's go to Detroit.
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
Whatta you think?
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
Just hung up.
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
Half for doing what?
We made it, didn't we?
Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
Wait.  You not Adele?
Who?
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
How much for your company at chow?
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Like being back in the yard, huh?
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
If I could have a little more room.
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
I thought so, too.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
Is that right?
Faye Dunaway.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
You know who this is?
You won't do that.
I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
You like bourbon?
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
Oh, God...
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
You coming back?
When?
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
I'm not leaving Midge.
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
Islamic.
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
And so now you're off to Glades.
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
Do we have a gun in the car?
Take the next exit.
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
And is Foley a part of this?
Gee, I wonder why not.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
Here?  In this house?
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
You were talking in your sleep.
Not at all.
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
He waved to you?
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Midge.
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
...the fuck is this...
Are you sure they're here?
Yes Sir.
They ready, Earl?
Land of the free...
Then why are you looking for her?
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
How's everything?
Sorry.
No baseball diamonds, Red.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
I heard what you did.
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
Our doctor's gone too.
Oh, this is Betty.
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
Brilliant, Admiral.
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
Fook ya!
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
We're going to take you home.
I'll call you Later.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
Charlie! Am I dead?
Maybe I blocked it out.
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
Charlie. About last nights..
What am I going to do with you?
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
But what has to be different?
Does this mean you like me again?
Oh, Charlie.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
This is great reefer.
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
You think so?
Ssh. He's great.
What?
Young lady, you're drunk!
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
Damn that Charlie I
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
Quiet today?
He'll win.
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
What happened to you?
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
Maddy's party.
Would they go over my girdle or under?
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a four—eyed worm.
What was?
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
I	know what a burrito is.
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
Am I dead or not?
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
Richard, take it easy.
Give me some credit, will you?
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
I was building a doggy door.
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
How long ago did this guy retire?
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
What did?
You want me to help?
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
Are we interrupting, Andy?
What in God's name... ?
Do you really think so, Andy?
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
New baby?
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
What?
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
They didn't fire her?
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
What do you want?
Correct.
I've considered that.
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
No. I didn't.
Yes. On my torso.
I thought I was supposed to be covering for you.  God, Andy, you look awful.
Yes.
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...
Yes.
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
What did you say?
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
We're going to draw blood.
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
Good school. What year?
You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!
How many do you know?
Who?
Now that you mention it...
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
Let's continue.
Jesus.
Charles...
Charles...
Oh, Lord....
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
You did this? To yourself?
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
There....
...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....
How many bottles?
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
We just keep him locked up forever?
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
For your own fear.
79 kilos.
You mean that "load" of passengers?
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
One is all?
Hasan?
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
Well, you got the big gauge.
Such as.
So which one caught your eye?
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
An' this?
Not a star-jumper.
What, it's broken?
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
I apologize.
As you wish.
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
What's so special about him?
The blood transfusion.
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
'Then how do you account for me?,
'I am not a missing link.'
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
Got your sensors?
Yo!
Geiger counter?
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Huh?
Landon! Send a last signal.
long pause) You know it.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
She comes along too.
I want her.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
Read it yourself.
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
Of course.
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
Stop right there.
Of course.
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
Shhhh!
He's moving his fingers!
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.
I SHIT on all o' you.
Where the fuck is red platoon! Tell 'em to get their asses up here! What the fuck you doin' back here Elias? Round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.
We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here. 
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
Youse so fucked up man.
Come on you can do better than that!
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
'People say I'm the life of the party cause I tell a joke or two although I may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside I'm blue...'
Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
I really don't know.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
How long would that take?
Immigration Officer?
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
And do you amuse the guests?
You said it wasn't a tragedy.
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
Nice of him.
Want a spike in it?
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
Dance? Here?
They know you here--know your name.
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
So have I.
No percentage in that.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
Killaine...
This must have cost a fortune.
Killaine's wise.  We can't wait any longer.  Here, put this on.  But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I'll tell you when. 
In a way.
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
Beer?  Well, all right.
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
Please answer my question.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
That's an evasion and you know it.
We wouldn't have met at all.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
Because you think your in love with me?
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
Got the information on you?
You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?
How are your teeth getting along?
How's life treating you?
Round of golf Saturday?
It was lying where on the balcony?
In case you want to have us followed.
Time for a little chat?
A couple of hours.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
I had a father who knew how to steal.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
A little something on account perhaps?
I don't think you locked your door.
What do you want?
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
He saw my face too.
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
Recently, then.
I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
I've met her.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
Now, you're being beastly.
That leaves two strangers.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
I don't know, sir.
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
"Physical description: Age 26, Height 5  1 3/4 inches: Weight, 188 pounds: Light brown hair: Deep blue eyes: Small, perfectly formed features: Ears and earlobes small: Slender build: Wears size 4 AA shoe: Quiet refined manner: New York accent: No charges pending.

Would your sensibilities be offended, if I sent out a general alarm to pick up this girl?
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
Nice.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
History books are first onto the bonfires.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.
Shall we go?
What went wrong?
How's Mary?
I'll have some of that.
So it's all worked out perfectly...
I think it went on rather too long.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
I haven't really thought about it.
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
Oh yes.
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
You're a piece of shit
What period?
All right.
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
That's good.
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
You first!
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
Where's Roach?
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
You never were...
Sir?
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
Angelo!  Don't fire!
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
What are you talking about?
What?
Like the old days, Dillon.
Mean anything to you?
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
Mmmnnn...?
Your uncle will like this.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
No, you look like a hooker.
The price just went up to ten.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Stolen?
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
For the whole night?
Diet coke.
It's a very good year.
Did you sleep well?
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
No?  Why's that?
The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
All right.  How much for the week?
Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
I'm not just talking about sex.
Why not?
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
He's good at what he does.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
What if I lose it?
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
Did you?
What do you mean?
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
You're packing.
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
My what?
What!?
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
Vivian's in sales.
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
Did I wake you?
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
Looks slow tonight.
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Who did you think?
It was great.
Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
Want a pair of boots?
And who is that?
Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you.
Hi, Barney!
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
Should I be?
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
And what am I?
Of course you will.
Gently.
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
He's really very short on charm.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
What?
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
It won't be easy, Sire.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
Could this be a trap?
And our assets?
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
Do you always begin conversations this way?
How old were you?
You guessed wrong.
-- get back, witch --
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
Nobody's hearing nothing!
Congratulations.
"By the light, by the light,
"Of the silvery mooooon,
"I want to croon,
But sir, I'm not condem ...
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
Assume away!
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
Will you get a hold on yourself.
Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
Really, I never dreamed ...
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
We can't play today?
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Ta.  Ta.
Nietzche...
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
What have you done, LSD?
No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
No. At least I don't recall.
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
Don't know where she got "Marie," but "Samuels" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam.  Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?
What do you mean?
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
Now, look...!
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
She stole some money.
Please!
I still feel...
With you.
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
She'll need both of us.
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
Does that mean we can't...
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
Watch your tenses.
What makes you sound so certain?
Sorry.
What is it?
Sam!
You can't laugh at it, huh?
I have to go, Sam.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
Dirty night.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
You'd know, of course.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
What are you running away from?
Except you.
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
Thank you, Norman.
Very early. Dawn.
Frankly, yes.
Mary is Lila's sister?
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
Mother, please...
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Just before she died she came to--
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
No-
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
You--a friend to me?
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
Thousands?
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
What is it?
That spoke to you?
That called ... commanded ...
The child!
Yes.
There's no child here.
Why didn't you eat last night?
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
We'll be coming to the opening.
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
Now don't that call for an extra!
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
Call the Homicide Squad!
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
Oh, is that what caused it?
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
Is that a fact?
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
She is the soul of that statue.
Could we go somewhere?
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
But who were they?
They were just bad men, that's all.
In what sense were they bad?
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
Yeah, he's still up there.
In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
She's watching the car again?
This is my place and you can't have it.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
How could that be, son?
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
Turn up your hearing aid.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
Well, she's back.
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?
Rose, what are you doing up?
You're so sweet.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
Yes, sir.
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
Well. What kinda job is it?
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.
Yes, dear, what is it?
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.
You're not gonna see him again.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
Now you know what to watch for...
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Kittle...
How's your precious little school-marm today?
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
Where you gonna be?
No offices are gonna be open today.
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
Yeah.
They shot us all, kid.
How you doing back there?
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
It doesn't say that.
That's him alright.
What the... ?!  What was that for?
Where we going?
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
You can't be serious.
He went to pick up lunch.
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
Oh yeah?
Get closer!  Don't lose him!
You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...
What... ?  Not you too?
That's not true.
You need a doctor.
A.D. is a C.P.A.
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
I don't think so.
Yeah.
This shit was Ming.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
What is thy bidding, my Master?
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
Han! Chewie?
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
Here we go again.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
I know, father.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
The future is ours so let's plan it.
Janet.
What was that bang?
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
No, don't do that.
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
What a guy
And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread.
The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
It's Thanksgiving.
Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
Yes, I do.
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
I don't think I belong here.
No, I don't belong here.
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
Don't want weak legs.
...Are you going to say anything to him?
Wanna hear a dirty joke?
What was that you said about a pet shop?
Apollo?
...I dunno.
It's not your house --
Don't do that again!
Owe you what?
...That boy damn near broke my arm.
...That man's takin' his job too serious.
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
One more round.
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
Don't like yours neither.
Kiss my ass.
Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'.
Few minutes?
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
You can forget about sparring, kid.
A hundred an' thirty.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
Ya sure?
You think I don't hear things?
Excuse me.
Hey --
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
What?
...What?
Come July, twenty-five.
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
Yeah --
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
Ya puttin' me on?
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
...What?
Ya got heart.
What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein.
Ya nose is broke.
...The guy's great.
How you holdin' up, kid?
Wanna keep goin'?
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
Yo, Paulie.
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
The girl's dryin' up! She's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! You're a pal, Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow.
...Sure.
What kinda business?
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
What's ya sister like to do?
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
It don't bother me none.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
Whatta you think?
...I can't haul meat no more.
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
So you decided to help him after all?
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Does it hurt?
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
What's with the dip?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
I don't work in Toontown.
When will I hear from you?
I've already seen your photographs.
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
Pattycake!  Pattycake!
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
No, kid, you're a real hero.
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
Quarrel sir! no, sir.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
No, cuz, I rather weep.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
Amen
Ahhh!
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Why, may one ask?
I dream'd a dream to-night.
That dreamers often lie.
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
Pink for flower.
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
What wouldst thou have with me?
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
Why did you do that?
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers?
Is that right?
Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
There's been a slight problem.
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
And you respect him.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
So this is what, a test?
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Long enough to shoot back.
Is that right?
You should watch what you eat.
Is that right?
Something like that...
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
You would have done that?
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
You think?
Give me a cigarette.
Business keeps you on the road?
No you don't, and you know it.
Do we need anything else?
Just like that?
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
I told you, I quit.
My man, how you doing?
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Don't spend it all in one place.
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
Well someone's gonna find them.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
He's going to be trouble.
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
Then we're screwed.
That's right.
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
How are ya?
You mean that guy was an agent?
Yeah?  So?
OK.
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
How are we going to do all this?
I don't know, Booth.
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Don't you have to be here?
Dwayne.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
All right you’re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
I didn't say that.  You did.
Dwayne -
How's work?
At least around here it does.
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
You think he skipped town?
Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
How much is that?
The band has been playing over an hour.
What??  Where'd you hear that?
I got my sources.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
So what's your story?
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
I said get on your feet!
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
You bring American money?
Oh yes, she's very nice.
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
Hello.
Well, hurry up.
This is a very dangerous man.
Where are you going?
It's my job!
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
You.
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
I'm okay, you go.
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
He'll be back soon.
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
I don't want to hear this.
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
Fine.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
How was the sex?
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Vegas...
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
Carter...
Yes.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
Did you tell Sterling?
Ricky Tan?
Shut up!
And that, of course, would be me.
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
Did you make the plate?!
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
Let's go.  Everybody take off?
Yeah, it's good.
Want some?
Which one?
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
How much they want?
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
You got a boy friend in here yet? ŒCause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
Hello.
I do.
You don't understand this guy.
Got any last minute advice?
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
Of course.
And in a "V".
-- It's for you, Ike.
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Looking for Maggie.
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
Like her mother.
Originality is my speciality.
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Seven-fifty.
I don't know.
No.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
Yes I do!
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
A little longer for me.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
I love you.  I love you.
I'm listening.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
Where?
I'm going to kill myself.
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
What happened at the luau?
No, you tell her.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
Is there somebody else?
You take the microwave?
I hate boats.
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
Even when you were young?
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
We'll stay at the Plaza --
Who is it?
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
No.
I do.
So what happened?
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
I should say something in this about magic.
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
But he saw you, right?
You don't know who she was, Annie --
What about the letter?
No, I know that part --
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
Please --
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
Destiny takes a hand.
Magic.
Mom, we already...
Sure you do.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
You'll like it.
Dad --
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
Will she scratch up your back?
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
Jonah, I'm leaving --
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
Did you call that radio station again?
Have you seen my wallet?
What's wrong with Annie?
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
You look good.
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
You're welcome to one.
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
You want 'em all arrested?
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
How goes it?
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
What's more important than sanitation?
A fighter, huh?
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
What were they saying? About you? In there?
No.
How do you feel?
A meeting?
No.
Like what?
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
But honey ...
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Go on. Spill it.
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
Luís! Come down here!
Ramón ... listen for the love of God ...
What?
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
Yeah.
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
Not even a guess?
Ride 'em cowboy)
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
Go ahead.
Why not?
You don't understand.
I can't leave.
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
That's long enough to get out of town.
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
Never heard of him.
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
It's me.
You can still work.
Why not?
What's wrong, Danny?
What time is it?
Sorry.
Why does it have to feel so bad?
Was he the president?
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
Wait till I tell you what it is.
No one ever noticed?
What does that mean?
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
Can we talk price?
Why do you say that?
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Don't you wonder why I do it?
What the hell are you doing here?
You think this is funny motherfucker?
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
Turns out he's connected.
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Don't worry about it.
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Yes, sir.
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
You must be a hell a shot.
Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
Glad of it.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
That only leaves three.
What about our grenades?
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
Caen?
Beasley's dead.
What about Talbot?
You get a translator, Captain?
Maybe.
Nope.
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
Vecchio.
Yeah.
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
I'm listening, sir.
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
What if our guys open up, sir?
Here they come.
Don't do that again.
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
For going to school?
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
I'll be in my office.
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
Alright.
Lloyd, it's us.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
Wait a minute.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
I can put that together.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
Ha!
I just had a phone call.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.
What happened to you?
Swear to god.
What am I supposed to think?
Honey, about what?
I made their lives better.
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
Whoa.
Keymaster?
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
Nobody knew me before tonight.
It's just you and your dad, right?
Twisted?
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Job?  Being a great date.
You think so?
What did you say?
Yeah.  With potential.
Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
I don't think I am.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
It did?
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
Why didn't you tell me?
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
You told your dad?
I'm sorry.
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
Lloyd.
Hey.
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
You took my workers.
When?
So I'm responsible for the weather?
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
How many?
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
We need to talk.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
I didn't do enough.
We know that, son.
No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
Don't. Think Bailey.
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
What if I said you?
I thought you were going to the mixer?
I did that.
It helped me realize one thing.
And much richer as a result.
My documentary is due on Tuesday.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
No, it's not.
Why?
She's got guards with her.
And now, drum roll please...
Or it found us.
Miss Weathers.
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
I see you read the book.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
I never meant to imply...
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
You broke my heart.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
..and as lonely as I am...
Dewey?
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
Someone’s trying to kill me. I need the police.
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
I have rehearsal.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
Who is that guy?
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
..harmonica style is okay.
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
I get scared really easy, okay.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
Jesus.  Hello?
I don't know.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
What?!
Where are you?
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
Alright Kincaid, no where to?
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
Who?
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
None.
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
Who's this?
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
Yes.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
What? She asked.
You ready to party hard tonight?
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
Yes, sir.
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
Yes.
I don't know.
Do I?
Just some scary movie.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Gotta go.
What do you want?
I'm getting scared.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
I don't know...
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
Can I bring Kenny?
What are you doing here?
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
Just stay back.
I want to talk to you.
Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
...out at the airport...
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
We had a run in the mass murder section.
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Thanks, Tatum.
It's past seven.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
I bet he's pissed.
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
What do you think about when you're having sex?
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
That's mature.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
Where we headed?
Murderers?
Murderers like you?
Delusions of grandeur.
I'm a little thrown.  I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.
You just met me.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
Not here.
And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
Who said this was murder?
What?
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
Same color and texture.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.
No witnesses of any kind?
Nothing.
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
Does this make it with you?
And?
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
That is.
What are you talking about?
Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Murders in the Rue Morgue.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
You do your job...
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
Wait!
Tell me it's not true.
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.
Are you absolutely certain?
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
But Mose Harper said...
You askin' me to clear out now?
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...
Well, the reward still stands...
Scar! Where's he holed in?
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
What you want me to call you?
You all right, Ethan?
What you goin' to do?
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
You ask her!
Ethan, quit it!
Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?
Stop that!
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
Maybe the antenna's broken.
Hey... the fuse.
You?
Maybe an animal.
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
How did you get me out of there?
For God's sake, what happened to me?
I really hate to bother him, but...
But what is the truth?
Hello.  Can I help you?
Thank you, my lady!
What is the chief part?
Words, words, words…once, I had the gift…I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones…for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery…but now
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
Interesting.
It's a comedy.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
What's the title?
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
How?
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
God be praised!  Locked?
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
Will! Have you finished?
And yours?
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
And--?
"…All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
"…Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
Like you, I found him not at home!
I am.
Moonlight!
Oh, do not go
I know how to fight!
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
Orsino…good name
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
My lady VIOLA.
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
If you love her, you must do what she asks.
She loves me, Thomas!
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
I'm only asking what you think.
Alex, I don't have the time --
I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
You think so?
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
You're sure? There's lots more.
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Cameron?
So we'll meet him, then?
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
David hasn't seen him either.
So I gathered.
What?
Hello. Hello.
Are you all right?
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
What are you doing here?
I'll wait there.
Are you all right?
Of course.
did you hear anything before he cries?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
I see.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Are you all right?
Two hundred pounds.
What?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
I thought you'd gone to work.
Yes.
You get the job done.
You must be Hugo.
What do you do?
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?
Is it real?
Chicken salad.
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
Don't you like her?
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Then what's the problem?
That kid... the hairdresser.
That you were just indulging me.
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
-- is that right?
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
Whatever you say.
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
Your husband?
Yes.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
Shit.
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
... just, you could look very heavy...
Don't make conversation with me.
What?
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
I guess not...
You know what I'm talking about.
Hey, I don't tell.
Baby...
-- gee...
That sounds like me.
Sammy's?
-- very nice, very nice.
-- ass and legs --
-- good afternoon --
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
You're going to kill me.
It's too late...
What for?
-- Right after I sprayed her?
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
Otis is dead.
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
There were some shots.
What?
You're great.
Do you really mean that?
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Yeah, baby...
Okay.
They didn't offer you the job yet.
When is that?
I'll call you.
A friend dropped me off.
Ha, ha.
Television or movies?
-- go ahead.
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
How come you took your own car?
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
How?
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
In a way. But...
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
Oh yeah?
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
I wanna hear about it.
Didn't they tell you?
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!

Awww --
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
They get hair all over the place.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
Nothing.
It must be something.
I thought you said things were great with George.
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
Honey?
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
Is he an enemy?
Good for you.
George? Was he alone?
Two weeks from tomorrow.
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
Do you have children?
Everything okay, son?
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Yes.
Maybe he showed me something.
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Mommy!
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
Well how can I repay you?
Advocaat is it?
Won't keep you a moment, sir.
Delbert Grady.
No.
She eh... interferes.
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks.
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
It's good to see you.
No charge?
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Sure is.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
He's still asleep.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Stop swinging the bat.
Go away.
Go away.
Yes?
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
five months of peace is just what I want.
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
They'll love it.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
What time does the plane leave?
The moon's not down yet...
Please, Uncle Al.
You booger.
There's something else scary.
What is it?
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
Yeah? Really?
What you say?
LET THY SPIRIT
Were you tempted?
And I'm tearful!
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
What you do?
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
Oh, girls.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
Why?
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
Pay attention...
What?
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share?
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
What?
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
I don't want to mess anyone up...
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
A what?
What's wrong with my life?
Yeah?
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
What?
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
He's a businessman.
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
Really?  Lieutenant?
No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
Oh-huh.
You won't even tell us?
I can't see anything in here!
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
She's... she's a nun.
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
We must be a curious sight to him.
Bring him.
Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Chosen me?
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
We should not go much further in this murk.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
What is it?
What good is this?
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
Baltus Van Tassel.
He has proposed to me twice.
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
Blood.
It was you there?
And, what did he say?
The church.
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
It appears well.  It has already clotted.
Let her go!
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
Go home.
She did not do it... please listen...
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Can I see him?
You have any biscuits for sale?
French-fried potaters.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
How'd your baptizin' go?
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
I ain't sure.
Childers.
I want to be baptized.
Don't hit that boy no more.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
What numbers do you punch?
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
Don't you live somewhere?
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
Were they bad people?
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
Hey Karl, you off work?
I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
So it died when it come out?
No sir.
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
Yeah.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
Karl, you up?
I'll be.
You scared me.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
Why are you here now?
Yes sir.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
Why?
Yes.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
Will that be cash or charge?
And your father? Is he from New York?
American literature. What else?
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
What'll it be, Auggie?
Do me a favor, will you?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
A photographer ...
They're all the same.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
What do you mean?
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
I'm all ears.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
And what's that supposed to mean?
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
Five thousand bucks.
It's all yours, baby.
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
It'll cost you five bucks.
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
It was just a thought.
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
That's where the what comes in.
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
Eight-thirty.
Are you going to be all right?
You don't really want to know.
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.
Why don't you go to the police?
Thanks. 
Celebrate? What for?
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
I'm not going to do it.
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
Well, what then, sergeant?
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.  I didn't have a lawyer...
Yes.  Initially.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
Still a coincidence.  Timing and all.
If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
I believe so.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
Such as?
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
Which of you dolls is Daphne?
Hi, Mary Lou - Rosella - Okay, Dolores, get a move on - How's your back, Olga?
You know, Bienstock, there's something funny about those two new girls.
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
What happened?
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
I told you - it's a sure thing.
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
It did?  Boy, did it ever!
Right.  We have the same blood type...
Nellie told us about it.
The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
DAPHNE?
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
I got pinched in the elevator.
Blow where?
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
And where's he going to be?
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
Shut up and keep packing.
Not that, you idiot.
Get me Room 414.
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
No, no.
And your head is hot.
How's the bottle?
We better have a drink first.
And bring the cocktail shaker.
I'm a what?
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
It's about the Florida job.
What's wrong with us?
We could pass for that.
You invest in shows?
No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
You must be quite a girl.
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
I forgive you.
Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
What kind of band is this, anyway?
We'll take it!
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Put it here.
Yeah.
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
Thanks, honey.
I don't think so.
Thank you.
Your view of what?
How's the stock market?
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
- Inauguration balls -
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
Would you mind moving along, please?
Well, I guess I'd better go -
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
Oh - in here.
What a beautiful fish.
Oh - a member of the herring family.
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
What's on Thursdays?
Completely.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
Have you tried?
Complete washout.
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
Good morning.
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
Good evening, sir.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
We got different information.
Big joke!
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
And who runs it?
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Except it’s Scotch.
Pub Golf?
Hey.
Or Kat....
She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
What’s going on with you two?
Seeing you again....
Let me guess. Amy presumed I’d forget the rings.  I think I’m her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.
What did he say exactly? I mean, you don’t think he wants me back?
I don’t know.
What?
Your “friend” guaranteed my anonymity.
It’s hard to explain.
Don’t they have a limit at those machines?
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
But nothing did.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It’s all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, you’re not walking away!
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
I should go.
Like fifteen.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
You want I nut him in the boat?
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
I am now, sir.
You don't live around here, do you?
And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
What's his name?
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
No, Miss Johnson...
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
We didn't find Sounder yet.
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
They gone to the field...
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
Did you see Daddy?
Any sign of Sounder?
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
Can't sleep?
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
You ready to eat?
How's the weather out there?
But, Nathan--
Will they give him a trial?
What... are you?
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
What?
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
-no Cheesy Poofs.
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
Suck my balls.
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
Cartman?!
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
You've got a stupid accent too.
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
Who are you, kid?
Viva la Resistance.
May I?
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
Mrph?
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
What's that?
MOM!!!
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
Who is it?
It's so very cold...
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
How can they do this?
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
Does it say what the clitoris is?
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
I thought you had something planned.
Oh, brother.
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
What about air strikes?
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
Hello, Conan!
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
Ow, you're hurting me!
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
What's the matter, Wendy?
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
I think we're moving.
Oh yeah...
Jesus, come on!
Oh, thank you.
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
Were you going to give it to them?
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
So, are you on for the next one?
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
You better start making sense!
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Idiot...
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
It's getting hard to breathe...
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
Why can't we?
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
So what's going to happen to you?
So close...
Carlo!
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Baby, take it easy.
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
How is it looking, Mac?
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
You a mini-golfer?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
Hello Mr. Kastle.  Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
They suspended me for 100 years.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
That game was before you was born.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
No...
The whole world thinks you're underground.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
Knock-knock.
What did you do to Buzz?
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top. 
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
Look who's talking!
132, 154.
Like this?
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
Business.
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
Plan B is your dad.
He said he'd sponsor me.
Come on, bargain with me.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
I feel sick.
Why did you come back?
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
What about plan C?
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
Very professional.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.
Your time is up, busyboy.
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
Don't do it, Norman!
Norman, please!  Don't!
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
Anything else?
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.
From what?  What's with all the security?
Storm?  What storm?
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
What do you mean, he's missing?
I think I do.
Edmunds?
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
What the hell?  It shut us down.
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
What's the message?
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
A half a mile long?
Look at this.
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
Because when we get down there --
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
What?
Yeah, why?
Beth --
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
Beth --
Where are you going in such a hurry?
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
None of this was here before.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
But why is he doing it?
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "
For what?
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
No, he isn't.
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
That's when you went in the sphere.
Is it?
It's not safe for you to be either.
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
Get away from me!
Well, what's your theory?
Norman?  Where's Norman?
Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Why are you looking at me like that?
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
You holding up alright?
Nice work, Norman.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
What is that?  That noise?
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
She's cracking, Norman.
I can't reach her.
Push her, c'mon.
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
Meaning?
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
The ships?
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
What report?
Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
You want me to try?
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
What kind of a crash was it?
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
Who's going to pay me then?
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
They use the Bogan Force.
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
Are you sure you don't need it?
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
Here come six more... grid two!
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
I found it... It's just not there.
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
We'll send a squad up.
No need, everything's under control.
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
He was our teacher... He was great.
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
Are you alright ?
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
Profile's wrong... there.
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
I don't want everyone to see.
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Where'd it come from ?
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
What frequency ?
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
Are your parents currently citizens ?
Courage, I guess.
Best in the Fleet !
Alright, we're gonna carry you...
What is your position ?
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
They have repressed the Creator.
Yes.
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
To join, and become One with the Creator?
Yes.
... but I still recommend further simulation study.
I'm aware of that, sir.
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
Forward motion, Captain...!
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
One hundred kilometers...
Viewer ahead.
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
He have any special dietary requirements...?
I have one, but they lost it.
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
But why the dalmation?
Yes.
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
And likewise.
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
...who...?
You're still here.
<u>Yes</u>...
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Uh huh.
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
Sure did.
What's the scene...
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
Gosh, you look nice.
You'd do the newspaper right here.
That's something a man could do...?
Pelting down out there.
We could live up here, live up in the country.
But that's what happened.
But it'll stop the movie.
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
What are you going to do?
We on for tomorrow night?
What, what what are you doing here?
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
How old are you?
I...
You look at:  girl comes in the room, an <u>apron</u>, a brown <u>bag</u>, what is she...? She's a...
No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe...
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
Izzat so?
What's his name?
Will you help me out...?
I just...
This is Joe White.
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
I...I...
An artist of your caliber...
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
Kiss my ass.
What?
Main Street.
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
He didn't have to tell...
I'm looking for the writer.
He saw the accident...?
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
I...
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
I can only write on a manual.
That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?
I have to tell the truth.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
Hi!
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
I...
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
Did you bring Bob's weights?
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
I'm gonna' bring it off.
That's what I said.
Marty...
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
Mmm.
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
I've got two days to get this house...
...the city council...
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Ain't no second chances in life.
Why?
I'd rather be with Mommy.
I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?
Scream.
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
I could help with the debate.
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
Yes.
No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
This is my house too!
The timing was off -- I need this light.
Not use my words, please!
You do NOT run out on your moth...
Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
Yes...if you like big hair...
What honey?
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
Okay.  These are good.
May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
Machines do not EAT message.
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
However many.  It's not enough.
She was angry at herself.
You feeling all right?
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
Okay, I'm undeserving.
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
Why didn't I?
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.
You heard me: leave the table!
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
There's something I need to talk about with you.
Marty, ignore him.
I'll be your guest!
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Consuelo. Are you crying?
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
My baby.
Oh. How did it happen?
But still, you can't be sure.
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
The camerawork's nice.
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
What?
Ready for tomorrow?
What's tomorrow?
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
You know he hated my story also.
I dunno.
So? How was school today?
Again!
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Who is this?
Oh, fine. How are you?
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
That's good.
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
Gee, your Dad's smart.
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
So where'd you get in?
Can I see what you have so far?
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
What are we going to do!
What do you mean?
What do you think?
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
Now what?
Well Cooper...
She's still alive.
Good.
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
Good.
Don't be ridiculous.
Where is this...thing?
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
What?
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
No, sir.
Well, Mister President.
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
Yes, sir.
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
No, sir.
Plan-R????
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
That's close enough, Major.
I guess so.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
Then there's no chance for recall?
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
Maximum ECM.
A through H is correct.
Just the missiles.
Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
No, this looks like the real thing.
What does it look like?
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
You sure have to hand it to those guys.
Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
Sorry, King.
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
Sure, King.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Sure, all the time, in Group.
It was pretty bad, huh?
Was it okay?
Responsibility, progress.
Typical male.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
A cloud?
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
It's your birthday?
I'd get bored.
No, I'm not worried.
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Wait. Hey, man.
She's in the van.
Buff...
She's dead?
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
Come on.
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
Am I fucking him?
Yes! Free concert!
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
Good. See you later.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
Yes!
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
No, not really. Middle-class.
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
What about me? I don't have a car.
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
It's a mistake to think that.
Uh-huh.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
I hate that.
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
It's a piece.
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
Yes, you asshole.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
Yes, I stand for -
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Oh, yeah?
How?
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
What feelings?
And?
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
Mm-hm.
Oh, yeah?
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
Oh, no, no, no.
You're unbelievable.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
Do your covers and all that shit.
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
Hey, where's Erica?
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
I hope you're happy!
Pony, oh my god!
Is that your driver?
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
Yeah?
I'm always serious.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Yeah?
Alright, alright already.
If...
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
You do?
Yeah?
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Fucking drunk, huh?
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
Diane?  Diane!
And they get caught!
But, we have to make a smart plan!
... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
Spit from your dad?
Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.
Madonna.
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...
Hello?
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Yeah?
Ammo?
Bullets.
Or, I could get my own horse...
Hello?
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you?
The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
I didn't.
I had a teacher like that once.
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
You did?
O.K.  Where's the cash?
Check.
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
You're tough, all right.
It will?
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
We've made a lot of pictures together.
Fair enough.
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
I will not have it butchered.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
There sure is.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
What are the notes?
What's the matter with you?
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
He must be quite a guy.
Good night.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
Good.
Why do you say that?
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
This room has not been used for a long time.
The doctor suggested it.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
But what will happen?
Home?
I don't feel like it right now.
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
What do you want?
Maybe it was just an accident.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
Like it?
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
Let's talk about us, not her.
You're not afraid are you?
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
Are you asking me for a "date"?
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
They think I have a concussion.
I know it.
Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
A cheap trick.
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
Why?
You're going to take me back?
Not enough vodka in it.
Brad.
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
The kid needs a man to show him --
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Uh-huh.
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
Sure.
I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
I know, I'm the fault.
What about this week's check?
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
How do you do that?
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
Yeah? How's it look?
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
Watch out for them air pockets!
Thanks.  Let's go
You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
Ricky?  Where...what...
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
What terrific story?
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
But the other night...
Where's the light switch?
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
I don't kiss.
Storms! Floods!
We already have a super-tanker.
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
Oh Clark, no!
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
Everything on it?
Uh...home...
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
It's beautiful.
Wrong.
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
I asked the right question.
Shhhhhhh!
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
General --- ?
What about here?
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
Who?
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
But he's never there.
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
He's . . . cold. . .
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
Thank you.
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
He may have a gun!
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
So I've noticed.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
You think he's for real?
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
Krypton!
I read the article.
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
You?! How about me?
You're not going to hit me?
She knows. Clever, very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
You can't do this to me!
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
The good lord works in mysterious ways.
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
-- as we will be.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
He'll be weightless.
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
I guess I got carried away
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
Lois, the kickback story...
You've got me? Who's got you???
Wha'...what are you doing here?
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
What about it?
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun.
Of time, Luthor.
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
Ally.  That was my nickname.
How are you?
And what does he do again?
What happened?
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
I'll be back around nine.
Why?
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
It's natural.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
You believe that?
Why did you do that, Billy?
You talked about it?
Were his parents...attentive to him?
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
That's right.
What do you mean?
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
I didn't say that.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
No.  A little sugar though.
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
Isn't it a lovely day?
Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
It's like a song.
What's vermin again?
Nicole?
Yes.
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
The people in the town?
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
You seem very sure about that.
Dolores.
What about Doreen?
That's the local bar?
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
Is this it?
Why can't you talk to me?
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
That's not news, Zoe.
I need money.
What for?
We do.
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
Who did they get for that?
You think someone else caused the accident?
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
I was scared.
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
What do you remember about the accident?
Of course.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
Nothing.
Are you sleeping?
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters.  They're all inbred.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
Why?
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
I know Manny Davis.
Frankly, J.J., I don't think you got the cards to blitz me.
No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
Uh huh.
He means that much to you...?
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
But not for anything I did today...
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
And where was his wife?
The renting agent and the tailor.
Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
I made you write a beautiful song...
I get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around...
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
Steve, I...
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
Those lying motherfuckers!
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
Can I stop by my house?
You sure?
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
That is one of my mission parameters.
What?
Everything.
Affirmative.
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
Torque wrench please.
This is tactically dangerous.
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
It, John.  Not him.  It.
Ready to rock?
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Why him?
Why attack Russia?
You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
I guess you admire musicians.
Some.
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
Major, Major... he's here ...
What's not right?
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
Sure.
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
Who warned you?
Von der Null?
Von der Null?
And what did he say?
And what happened to Von der Nul?
What?
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
Stop this, please, stop this now!
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
Okay, so what is it?
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
Major.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
He did?
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?
Just let me go.
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
Reese...you got a first name?
What's he like?
You volunteered?
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
About what?
That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
And so you feel nothing.
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
Why were the other two women killed?
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Go!  Go!  He's got her.
Admittedly...
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
I'm not sure how this works.  Do you have something for me... ?  I got this note...
Don't even think about it.
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
If there was one.
Don't panic.  When security gets here, we simply explain what happened...
You deserted me.
There goes a thousand dollars.
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
Nice.
The maitre d' called you Christine.
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
That's a lie...
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
It's mine...
Stop talking...
Shut up!
Studied acting, I assume?
Hey there, Nickie.
Really?
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
But, will you?
I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T...
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
What have they been doing to you?
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
What?
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men, a few blocks away.  They took my wallet, money... all of it.  So...
Yes.
I need your car, Elizabeth.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
Oh... it's a game.
We provide whatever's lacking.
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
It was a different floor then...
I need the police.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Didn't I give you two?
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
Mr. Van Orton... ?
Ilsa... you're alright?
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
What makes you ask?
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
Did you worry about him?
Goodnight.  See you home.
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
Hey!  I heard screaming...
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
I, I just can't...
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
All the carvings.
Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
Why do you need a chain like that?
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
Watts?
Theo... Did you?
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
Italian?
I'm sorry.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
Hey.
When you find the guy, you'll know.
We'll find him.
Huh?
Terry Valentine.
Y'what?
That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
Did Jenny know?
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
That was one of them?
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
Steady on.
What d'you say, Elaine?
Didn't get it.
You look alike.
Sort a few things out.
That's not what I heard.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Disappointed.
I might've been away for the weekend.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
What's that, like a P.O. box.
Right.
Why not.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
I don't believe it.
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
He alive to see this?
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
How far?
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
How much.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
Ah yes, a music lover.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
...she can go up there.
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
I'll have it in a week.
Yeah.
All right.
Mm.
...Oh, Jesus.
But it's...
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
Where you going?
Who?
...What's so damn strange about that?
I don't know what's going on. I--
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
Not guilty, your honor...
...Probity.
...Huh?
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
Yeah.
Frank.
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah--
Yes, sir.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
I'll go down and speak to him.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
Behind you.
What doors?
What's left of it.
Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
Lieutenant!  It's me.
Got my hands full here.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
Come back and get me.
Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
What do you do?
We're not supposed to go back there.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
Oh... my... God!
Margo, you haven't heard?
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
What happened?
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
<i>A month.</i>
Close up?
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
Are we talking Emmies?
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
How about them?
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
You got it.
Poopy day?
Yup.
I think that about does it, Spooky.
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
I'm looking for him.
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
Before the bomb went off?
They want to discredit you -- for what?
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
I'll know soon enough.
What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
How can I reach you?
Did you find something?
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
Scully...
You're... quitting?
Mulder -- what are you doing?
I can't really talk right now.
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
What are my choices?
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
On whose orders?
And they want to blame us?
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
Mr. Mulder.
Is she alive?
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
Did we go sailing?
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
You don't know the procedure.
Where the hell are we?
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
Intravenous administration complete.
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
Nervous?
How's the patient.
Awaiting his arrival.
What about the cat?
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
How is she?
I don't have to.
Next time, tell me, okay?
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
No.
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
Drink?
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
In German?
H-E-Z-T...
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
Holly.
...Headquarters.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
I shall be all right.
His.
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
...parents.
I don't know.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Where?
Can you tell me whose...
When did you see him last?
Holly Martins.
I can't say that I have.
Very good, sir.
Shall I go over there, sir?
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
Welcome?
I know a very good dentist.
No, a major, were you really?
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
Hmm.
You can help her.
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
Coffee.
...were of you.
...you.
Vinkel.
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
...give evidence.
You gotta tell your story to the police.
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
Should I make it all fact?
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Richard. Hi.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
One or two kilometers.
So how many miles do you think it is?
We're ok.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
She is gone!
Bonsoir.
Hi.
I think so too.
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
I have a job.
Disease? What disease?
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
What's he care about?
When can I see you?
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
That's stupid.
Why should I submit?
Nazis talk about it all the time.
No. What are you looking for?
What'd you say?
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
Obviously.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
Leo Strauss...  I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
A poison...?
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
Female...
Listen to me....
But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?
I don't think you know what you are.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
I can't say that.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
Steve...
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
A Jewish prayer.
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
This will be a different kind of device.
When do you want it to go off?
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
They're not that Jewish.
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
Yes.
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
You're leaving?
Johana, am I boring you?
Did the driver really freeze?
You're right.  You're fired.
This is a great pleasure.
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Well, good night, then...
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
You risk your life when you cross the street.
Because you'd laugh.
He can learn.  He is learning.
Then tell him to wax it too.
Where did you get that?
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
The rules are the rules.
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
No.
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?
What?
You still collect them?
Yes.
You don't have that one, do you?
I don't want to erase anything.
That's good.
... Push me back in the water...
Don't you have a heater?
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
I don't know... why?
Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
I'm being a pain, huh?
Anything.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
I brought Johana to meet you.
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
Why is he doing this?
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
Keep going.
What are you doing here?
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
Where's my girlfriend Santa?
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
I drink.
Then what do you do?
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
I don't know.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
You really think so, Charlie?
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
The death card - -
Love is different for different people.
Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't ——
You know Charlie How-Come?
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
It was you, Galbraith!
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
Why?
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ——walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
What else do you care about, Kicks?
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Why’s that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess there’s space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistress’s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
Can it be that easy?
It’s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I’m told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you don’t require a definition.
Oh no. You’ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
Excuse me?
Laurence!
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. I’ll give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
I... Well, we’re burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but it’s late and with the funeral...
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you can’t satisfy him?
How... When did you...
What do you mean, ‘No’, Mrs De Moraes?
One just doesn’t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
I don’t.
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
...We’re turning in circles.
Here we go again.
To get me killed...?
I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
Okay. The woman just can’t walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why can’t you go to your Embassy?
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
I know where to look.
I’m sure I’ll find a way.
Look, you don’t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn’t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who’s the guy? The Austrian?
Have we done business before?
Why?
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
... Fine. I’ll go for the safe place.
...On holiday?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
Where are the kids?
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
Hello again, neighbour. I didn’t intrude, did I?
Oh... We split up.
Your secretary, huh!
Hello, Jane. It’s me.
Good afternoon, Mrs...?
Recommended?
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
Do what, Mr Lombard?
I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who can’t do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
I’m overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Huh... I’m sure there’d be lots of takers.
Trying to say something, Martin?
At what time will you be available?
Evening. Table for one?
Leon? No. I’m afraid he left.
Oh. This is... We’d arranged to meet tonight and I’m due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
What’s a French private investigator doing here?
You thought wrong. I haven’t seen Leon for months.
Haven’t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I’d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Did Leon tell you why he didn’t want the police involved, Rhian?
He just said he had good reasons.
Yeah... But he didn’t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent’s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leon’s Austrian was looking for you I reckon he’d have found you before I did.
I’m sorry. It’s just you don’t look local...
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
Welcome to the club.
Yeah. Why? You’re going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
Le montage, l’emballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors’ stuff. How much would it cost me?
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
Five seconds. Then you die.
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
Try again, and this time be polite.
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman who’d called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
They lost their son. Why?
What’s that? A word?
Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.
Majesty, I can't...
Very generous of you all.  How much?
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
I would like some fresh straw.
Now?
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
What did the king say?
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
Will you at least let me stay with you?
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
I'm already free...
I -- I don't understand...
I'm staying, Jean.
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
Yes, probably... maybe...
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English?  You look pretty ordinary to me...
Really?
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
In a village called Domremy.
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?
Not long ago...
Yes.
Many things...
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
What difference does it make where she comes from?
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?
That's not a lot.
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
Damn right!
No... not like this...
Did your voice tell you to jump?
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
My king.
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
I... I never lied!
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
In His name??
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Yes, my lord.
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
I don't want to wait for his call.
Someone you know?
Who are you?
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
Dorota!
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.
Sit.
What's happened?
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
Who told you?
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
What's the matter? Are you sick?
What are you reading?
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
Bitch!
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
I was listening, Kitten.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
Watch your feet!
No sound at all?
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
I worry for you.
I don't want to learn.
No.
No, words. You have never heard words?
Hello, then.
You the owner here?
What are ya gonna do, call the cops?
Yeh, go ahead.
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
Jesus, what a bundle.  Did you know he was that loaded?
Twist, you know this guy?
You're late.  Where you been?
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
If that's the way you want it.
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
Lonnegan after you, too?
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
It was too noisy.
Henry.
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
She coulda killed me last night.
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
Where you goin'?
You move right along, don't ya.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
I don't even know you.
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
So could Shaw.
Then why the rat?
I'm in.
No.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
Yes.  He admitted it.
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
What?
That is, if it's all right with you.
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
Your father?
Yes.
Where did you hit her?
I don't know.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
What would your mother say to that?
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
Only in bad weather.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
What's that to you?
Nothing.
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Well, what'd you think?
Who're you calling?
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
About three.
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
Do you think that Wynant did it?
I think we may as well sit down.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
I don't like him.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
What did you do with the rest?
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
Is Julia going with you?
I see.  I see.
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
If you like 'em like that.
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,
Who gave it to you?
Hello... send him up.
Who's that?
Aren't you hot in that?
Your guess is as good as mine.
You talk as if I were Asta.
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
You mean, he might be hiding there?
You wouldn't be a widow long.
You dog!
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
That's a fact.
Wynant's body?
How long has he been dead?
I'm going to tell her.
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
Got a nice evening dress?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Why are you saying it?
I hope you're well.
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
Yes.
I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?
Bonds, sir?
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.
What's it say?
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
You said he was a deserter.
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
I have to answer him.
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
What are you doing?
You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.
This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it.
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
Wh-what do you think--
They're not going to--
Why you got to move away to talk!?
My leg is falling asleep.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
Think there might be more Iraqis?
Get up and dig.
We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
We'll find our way.
How!?
Wes is dead!
No.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
And you; you've got it all together.
Epps?
Yeah.
Makes two of us.
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
No!
Well, we should identify ourselves.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
Oh, God...
And then what?
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
An Iraqi?
...Wes...?
Damn it.  We lost the horses.
The...the gold...
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
People are suffering.
Jaeger?
What?
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
Epps...
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
I think he wants something to drink.
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
I can't hear him.
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
You don't know.  You don't....
They don't know.
no...no, no.
Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away?  Economically, it's not sound at all.  Very much unlike....
THX and me.
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.
I want you for my roommate.
Where's LUH?
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy.
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
I'm leaving.
Right now.
...it doesn't matter.  The rest of it just didn't happen.
What was that....
No...no you're wrong.
I'm sorry.
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....
Yes...
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
Coffee, Mike?
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
So what were they doing here?
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
It's working.
Should we head for the Interstate?
Good, now the other side.
More metal... sharp edge...
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
What... ?
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
What do ay say?
Alright!
Alex-
Who are you calling, sis?
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.
Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match
A what?
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-
I'll do it.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
And diamonds in the front.
Diamonds all over.
Well, have you found it?
M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
I hope so, too.
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
M'sieu ...
Thank you!
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. 
Thank you, Baron.
Darling!  Now tell me--tell me all about yourself. Who are you?
Filiba ...
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
And you--
Lily-- 
Yes...?
Yes.
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
The same thing.
Um-hum ...
Then a little nap--
How do you like my dress?
Like that?
So you think you can get me?
I know it.
Then why do you want to go?
On the night table.
Ah, let me have a little fun.
Giron...!
Goodbye.
But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
The ship will sink.
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
Who's the best? Say it.
Holy shit.
What?
I told you you wanted to take this call.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
I know.  Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
I know what ice fishing is!
Mr. Dawson, I --
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
Is he your boyfriend?
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
Just some sketches.
No, no! Just with her hands.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
This is crazy.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
I know, I know.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie.
Would you like anything?
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
It's so unfair.
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
I'll join you later.
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
Oh--a hundred times--
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
I don't understand.
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
What did you want a gun for?
Could I see you a minute?
I thought you were one of my friends.
You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.
But I'll have cocktails with you.
A little.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
Don't let's talk about it.
What?--
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
What do you know about them?
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
Make it five.
Well, I'll be--!!!
Not here--follow me around the shed.
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
Shortie!--you know my motto?
How's your mother feeling?
How about you?
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
That's too bad.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
What's that?
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
I was never stiffer in my life.
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
Very serious?
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
Well, he has a straw hat--
--And he has sex appeal.
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
Eh?... Oh.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
What's the matter?
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
Let me look at it.
Ain't got time.
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Then why did you run away?
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
Where'd you get that horse?
But wait, you don't understand-
On three?  You call it.
Here, Doc.
What's wrong, Doc?
How you feeling, Doc?
Not exactly...
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
All right, Doc...
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
All right.  Then what?
A which?
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
That was lovely!
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
And I don't even know your full name.
Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me.
Florentino!  He's getting away!
Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.
Boy, look at all those stars.  Bet You can see every star there is. Practical touch 'em.  Kinda makes You think, you know?  I mean you Look up and you think God made All that but he still remembered To make a little speck like me. Kinda flattering really.  Hey, Wyatt, you believe in God?  No, Come on, really, do you?
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
Get down, boy.
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.
Acquired?
Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble.  And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.
Virgil?
It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark.
I call this the Rogue's gallery.
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
- Four wheel drive?
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
It must do something.
How is old Q?
That's reassuring.
Natalya?
Can you arrange a meeting?
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
Sidney Winch, meet -
They point, I shoot.
Thanks.  Take care -
Boyfriend?
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
... Do you have a gun?
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.  And thanks to your little show and tell -  - giving him the evidence -  We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Down?
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
Sabotage?
... And what do you call these?
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
No -
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
How sweet.
What the hell is going on?
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
Maybe. Maybe not.
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
What did your wife get her?
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
Yes.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
Will you still get the money from your father?
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
What for?
Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
Now how far would further out be?
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
Just stay in bed and rest.
You must have been really sick.
What happened to your hand?
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
How is he doing?
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
You must have done something to her.
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
Now who are we talking about?
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
I was just trying to make conversation.
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
To infinity and beyond!
Can I help pump the gas?
Which one can I open first?
Toy?
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
Sure is a hairy fellah.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
Spaceship.
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
What happened to you?
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Me?  No, no, no, no...  Are you?
She's sick!
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
Sir!  No Sir!
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
This is ludicrous.
Bad news?!
He's a pyjama case, really.
I like plaits.
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
Home is where the heart is.
Is that all?
Do what?  Oh, I see.
He'll murder you when he finds out.
I've got a present for you...
So had I.
Juliet who?
Victoria -
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
How much do I pay him?
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
Me, too.
Why?
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
My Leica's gone.
Did you meet the President?
Are you going to?
Hi.
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
How are your grades?
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
Have you done your homework, honey?
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
I feel good.
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
What do you think she wants?
I'll put this in the back.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
You're breaking my heart.
We aren't barbarians.
What's he doing up here?
We agree.
You should feel good about this.
Only if he can be trusted.
But will he be house-trained?
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
Any way we can do it better?
She's not at that place you sent her?
What?
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
OK. Same again?
You've stabbed me, man.
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.
I'm going home.
Where's that?
It's where I live.
Eh-
Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
No, not holding hands.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
Well, it isn't.
Unless you get caught.
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
Good luck, Spud.
Now remember --
But try too hard --
Exactly.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
What?
I can't believe you did that.
Are you serious?
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
Position, Bird of Prey?
Bob?
Oh, please.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Captain?
Yes, Captain.
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
To land any closer would risk detection.
I did not.
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
The emergency channel, open.
Spock?
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
No! No reply. Remain on course.
We must change our course at once.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
Your vision?
You are mad!
What have I done?
Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
I... have come to communicate with my User.
Well I want to communicate --
Alan!
Greetings, program...
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
A User -- in our world?
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
Feel what? You okay?
What's goin' on?
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
We have to get off this beam!
That's not true, honey--
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
Copy that.
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
Abu Kaleem Malik.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
She's lying.
She could be telling the truth.
But you didn't.  Why not?
So, it was your first time.
Yes sir.
It's certainly... dramatic.
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
Uh huh.  Okay.
What did you tell him?
What'd you do, honey?
I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
He needed my help.
You weren't attracted to him at all?
What did you need?
Louder please.
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
What about Juno?
What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?
Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.
Sorry.  Trade secret.
Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
What about the husbands?
Are you sure you weren't followed?
That was you?!
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
Were they trying to kill you?					*
And you chased one?
Helen.
It's a good thing you pay me well.
What do you want me to do?
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Has he looked through it yet?
Tell him to look through it.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
Where are you from.
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
Turn-offs?
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
How long have you worked here?
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
What?
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
What?
Write down Drexl's address.
You don't know him -
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
I'm hip.
Yeah.
If I thought I could get away with it -
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
You got it.
It's great to hear from you.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
Look, Dick, I don't -
What do you think, eightball?
The police department?
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Elliot.
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
Thank you very much, Clarence.
We grew up together.
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
You were a cop.
No shit?
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
Oh, don't bother. I got one.  So you're a Sicilian, huh?
Uh-huh.
That was a good fuckin' movie.
Do you believe him?
He'll wear a wire?
But a fuckin' baggie.
Or a bit player -
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
How the fuck could he know?
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
No way, JosÈ.
I'm not wearing a bra.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
So that...???
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
What kind of information?
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
July?!
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
You smell so good.
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
It was?  I didn't...know.
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
It's private.
What...???
I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
You have him in restraints.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
I said I was sorry.
Oh, Jesus.
Any parting words of wisdom?
Nothing.
It's a Movado.
Can I help you, sir?
The ticket is thirty dollars.
You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
What?
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
Let me have a Beck's.
What was that all about?
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Yes.  Yes it is.
Is that the way you want it, boy?  A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.
There's someone in the house.
I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
Thank you, John.
You're not from around here, are you?
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.
Did you ever?
Where?
Jake.
From?
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
John?  John where are you going?
I've thought about you every second since I left.  I can still taste you on my lips.
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
Grace . . . Grace?
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
John . . .?
But I want to say with you,
It's . . . it's locked.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
Where you headed?
Hey!
I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.
Would I what?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Make it twenty.
The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
You didn't kill her?
The time wasn't right.
I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
Jake--
There's another reason?  It better be good.
I came for Grace.
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
Not from where I stand.
It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
Honest, Toby.  I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
I want to stay.
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
She's dead.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
What the hell are you talking about?
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Stand up.
Nooo!
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
I think you might just want to do as I say.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
No police.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
I wasn't doing anything.
You expect me to believe that?
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
Who the hell are you?
You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole!
After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
I did?
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
You love her, but you hate her?
It's not what you think, Jake.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
What happened to your hand?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
Oz.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Look, Harlin.
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
I want my car.
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
That's right on my way.
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
What happened to your hand?
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
Wasn't nothing.
I just drove in this morning.
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
Nice place.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
You never did answer my question.
No.
I don't know how.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Where?
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
I wanted to talk.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I thought you couldn't get your car.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
Anywhere?
You know I thought you'd left me back there.
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
So, aren't you going to ask me?
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
Can you make it back up?
Why's that?
Where ya goin'?
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
I need a ticket.
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
Yes?
Wow.
What does that mean?
I don't know. It's been a while.
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
Oh shit...
What was that?
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
That's not what I witnessed David.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
What's he look like?
When?
I'm going to go in.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
No.
No Jeremy.
I see.
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
No.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
I fined 'em instead.
You told them cowboys you had it.
We was... lyin'.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
Is... is it... loaded?
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
Yeah, I guess so.
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
She gave me the evil eye.
Well, she...
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
Three.
That fella come by... Tom.
Did I what?
Who said that?
Far enough.
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
We done that stuff.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
Who ?
&lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
Can we stealth these guys?
County. I was in for fraud.
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
What if I
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
I am sorry, Mr. McManus.  f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very                             + determined.
We're on vacation.
No, no, no, no, no.
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
I know he was good.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
That was all Fenster and McManus.
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
You're not safe on your own.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Very good.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
Yes.
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
Ed Concannon.
Objection, we've...
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
Neurology?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
I am seventy-four years old.
Yes.
I do.  Yes.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
I completely understand ...
I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
And you wrote that...
I appreciate--a man as busy as--
Yes.
I understand.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
What Hotel are you staying at?
Yes.  It was, actually.
A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
Maybe what?
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
They, uh, they got to my witness.
And what makes you so tough?
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
Hi, Mickey ...
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
So what?
Oh shit, what's today?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
I can't talk now.
You use their witness.
Uh...the admitting nurse...
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
It's not a good case.  It's a very good case.  A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...
But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
... I understand ...
Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Mrs. Simmonds.
Kathy Price...
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
Yes.
What did she say?
I did.
Dr. Towler...
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes.
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
And you like it.
Would you like a drink now?
Then?
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
How often does this happen?
I want you.
How can I see her, to know her?
That's Carlotta Valdes.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
But you knew about this.
I -- I --
What happened?
Did she hurt herself?
Judy Barton.
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
I told you! Right here!
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
I just want to see you as much as I can!
Yes.
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
I need you.
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --
You can't. You're afraid!
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
No.
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
Do you hear anything?
Only silence. It's always like this.
Where?
Long ago...
No!... No!
Vaguely...
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
Why?
Let me go into the church alone.
Yes... you run this hotel.
Oh, yes!
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
I know. Everybody tells me.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
What.
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Here you are.
You haven't told me everything.
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
What was this desperate urge to see me?
What is it, a still life?
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
Can't do what?
Multiple reasons.
What did you say?
You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
Are you sure this was an accident?
Wait. Wait a minute.
What?
We have to get going.
What is your problem?
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
I know and I'm honored...
Money?
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
So. When is the wedding.
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
What is it?
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
Shut up.
Call 911.
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
I'm calling the police.
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
What?
I don't know...
Yeah.
Hear what?
Isn't it a little late?
The hell you didn't!
Your ideas never work out.
Not true.
Israel doesn't have a King.
Not really, no.
Easy Micheal.
We're goosed.
How about my Fatburger?
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
You can't play around with these tent people.
Who else?
Charles Moore for instants.
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
I just don't see him in the big picture.
We're leaving in three hours.
Not yet.
That's sweet.
Well I do.
What are you doing?
What about the chairs?
Now?
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
What?
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
The prostitute.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
Like how?
No...
But...
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
I think so.
The first day.
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
Where's Boyd?
Pup corn?
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
"You Send Me."
Oh I know that. How does it go...
The stone age.
Take your time. I wish I had.
Give them to Refugio.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
Which couch?
You have no feelings toward ...
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl.
What will the lady say?
She won't even know.
How much is that?
Fifteen yards.
Me?
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
What do you know about me?
What are you doing here? Get out.
Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
Is she coming back?
How much do you want for him?
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
Things seem to be getting better.
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
You cannot leave ...
Why not?
Very, very?
I had so many things to think about!
Don't talk like that!
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
From the terrace.
You son-of—a—bitch, I'm going to kill you.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device —— it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
On my life, I promise you I will.
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
You think he's smart?
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby— trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
What did you find out?
This better not be a wild goose chase.
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
It's nano—technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
... and you get nano—death.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
You need a maid.
What's wrong with Parker?
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
You catching my drift?
You ready for this?
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
Don't worry about it, all right?
We know you didn't kill those guards.
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
More or less.
Then shoot him already.
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
Ames here.  <u>Yessir</u>... 
...mmm?
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
Naa, fuck this, this is nothing.  Oh, Lord -- this just got <u>Big</u>.  I see it -- <u>Big</u> -- Big for <u>you</u> and big for <u>me</u>.
...you want us to go to War...
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
What do you know about them?
In the yellow ribbon.
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
Why is this putz on the air...
...hell of a price for the country to pay.
Eight Days To Go 
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you, sends his thanks.
Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?
How's your wife?
That's not bad at all.
Wilfred.
Courage, Mom.
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
Quite touching.
THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING THE PHOTOGRAPH
ON MOSS, AS HE WALKS THE GROGGY SCHUMANN TOWARD THE GAS STATION.
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
S'only got to hold for another few days.
Why do people go to war?
...Yes.
When's he coming back...?
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
They got to have something that we want.
W...what?
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
I think it's fine?
What?
Mmm.
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave us "special prisons."
Mmm.
Finish Strong!  Are you <u>nuts</u>?  Are you nuts?  This's Pennies from <u>Heaven</u>... on his triumphal return home, Old Shoe, his Plane Forced Down...AND YET...
He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
They'll be here in ten minutes.
What're you doing?
I'm looking for a phone...
Stanley.  Stanley... you knew the... Stanley.  You knew the deal when you signed <u>on</u>.
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
Better.
They guard our, <u>you</u> know ... "borders," night and day...
This is <u>nothing</u>,  Wait'll you've worked with a movie star, one time, this is nothing, we keep him shot-up and happy -- the Old Days, I used to think I was a <u>pharmacist</u>, the kind of stuff I had to do.  One time...
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter.
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
... That's what you told us to say.
He's lying.
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
...gotta read my reports.
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
The FAA announcement.
Don't start, alright.
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
What if he asks where I got the money?
Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
I don't know anything!
So, where are we going?
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
I don't understand.
I'll be right there, fix them a drink.
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
You could have a great beach house for that.
Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
Bud! Where you been the last two days?
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
I can't...and I won't.
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
Your books Master Loftmore
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
We're all here, and ready sir!
What?  Tony and China, together?
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
That's not what you said last night.
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
Oh that explains everything.
This time I really don't see anyone man.
Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
That's not true.
What do you mean?
I started seeing things.
I didn't want to come.
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
That can't feel good.
Of course.  You must be so proud.
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Yes?
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
Tell me.  I can help you.
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
Um...sure.
What was her major?
...just so she could cut them off.
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
It's niiice.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
Nothing's happening.
Oh...
Then what was it?
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Adamant?
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.
What's their name?
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
It's okay if you're not.
Tired?
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Maybe we should just...
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
That's not what I'm sug--
Claire...
I know.
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
Well, that's nice.
What?  No.  No.
Sorry.  You understand.
What?
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
Dressed?
Oh.
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
...like it never even happened...
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
I take it your not mad at me.
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
It's alright.
What?
You don't have to do that.
I don't believe you.
Are you alright...?  You look pale.
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
Michael, Rowan should -
Hello...?  Who is this...?
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
FAST.
Explain this to me --- violated...?
There is no one here but the dead.
I LOVE him!
I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
What is wrong...?
No!
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
Oh god...
Yessss...
You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
Doctor's orders- - -?
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
We're quite a pair, you and I.
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
What about your work back home...?
Maybe he's just - waiting...
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
That's GREAT!
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
You look a little green.
Mm-hmmm...
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
You alright...?
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
You can't just -
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
I heard something like that
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
This must be one of the old keys -
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
So what do you do?
I'm a dentist
I don't know
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
Tell me how it happened...
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
Dead?
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
You're late, bro!
Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven."
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
What gives, Don Corleone?
Yeah?
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Which you pulled, hard!
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
The lesson being?
Whatever helps you cope.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Hmmm?
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
James, what are you doing here?
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
You want it in writing?
I miss them, too.
That's a crappy thing to say.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
Your article sucked.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Where are we going?
But you never do.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
I'm trembling with excitement.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
I want you to trust me.
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
Very ambitious. I like that.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.
As much as possible.
My parents always say hard work builds character.
People pay good money for that?
Kelly.
You look pretty.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
No.
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
You saw the news today?
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Yeah.
Did he come in with you?
At that point were you able to fight him off?
Where's this coming from?
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
I said he did.
A ride.  You want one?
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
What are you looking at?
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
Where, the mall?
So, where you off to now?
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
I love you.  Now give me the line.
But check this...
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
Just like that?
You can't...
Will they?
You, Kelly, Sam.
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
Sam, for godsake.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
Are you mad at me?
Jim West.
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Is this leading somewhere?
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
Uh... how long ago was this?
You might have mentioned you had that.
Thank you.
What is that?
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
Not again.
Oh, thank you.
It was in your book.
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
And?
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Dr. Pemberton?
Are you all right?
Well?
They're coming.
Yes...?
Not today, Willow.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
Are you okay?
You all right?
Smells like a battle.
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
Madmartigan, I need your help.
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
You?
Watch it!
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
How??
Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
Who is he?
Queen Cherlindrea?
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
Cows. You know, cows?
Your hole is healed, then?
Amish.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
So one of them got to him.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.
Johnny –
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
Because – somehow – they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
Where are you taking us now?
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Does anybody know I'm here?
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
Something wrong with buttons?
You know carpentry?
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him –
No? Why not?
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws –
Dorothy!
If any!
...have you come back?
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
Ohhh!
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
Oh --
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
Yes -- let's run!
I'll be home in time for supper!
Supposin' you met an elephant?
Because I'm still scared!
Oh -- Oh, come on.
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
...free!
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Here -- here --
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
Where -- where do we go now?
It's a whatzis?
You don't get around us that easy!
... about Dorothy.
Beautiful!  What an echo!
That's right.
It's a whozis.
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
Shame you had to spot I wasn’t the real thing.
It’s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
Makes her look even more innocent.
What is it?
What kind of bikes did you ride?
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He’s a man of great integrity.
It’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
He survived?
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
They’re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I can’t help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
I can’t stay.
No. You’ll be safe here.
...what?
I could have given you the world.
All this, because you fell for Renard?
You, of course. I need some information.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
Now...where were we?
No!  Get me out!
The Maiden’s Tower.
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  It’s what you wanted.
What about our end?
Had a lot of blood in him.
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
What -- am I --
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
What??
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
Laurie --
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
What the hell -- ?
What?
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
Those cars.  What year is this??
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
So do I.  So do you.
. . . That was quick.
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
What do you mean, frame-up?
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
We should get back --  What?
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
Like what?
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
When can I see you again?
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
Nothing. He had two days.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
What's "Anarchy 99"?
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
It's too far.
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
The intention of registration act -
Come with me and I'll let her live.
The point of what?
The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
To find Rogue.
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
Don't you knock?
What did she do to me?
A piece.  Only a piece.
Where did you get this cauliflower?
From your office, sir.
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
MMmmm.
You have your tickets?
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
This is the only library I know of.
Why did you do that?
Yes, sir.
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
How old are you, young man?
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
What wockers?
Just putting up some tea.
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
Hmm!
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
If you like -- just hurry!
You're sure you know what you're doing?
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Yes.
How's it going?
What did you find out?
Where is he?
Thanks...for all your help.
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
What's that tune that you're playing
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
A god?
Right here?
Do you think you can sing it?
Good night, Doctor.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes, I have mine.
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
How do you know they're done?
How long is it so far?
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
