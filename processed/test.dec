Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Let me see what I can do.
Forget French.
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
What crap?
Let's go.
Is he oily or dry?
Hi, Joey.
I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Perm?
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
Never
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
Will Bogey get bent?
Dead at forty-one.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
Do what?
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
Neither has his heterosexuality.
Funny, you're the only one
You don't care if I die
Pleasant?
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Try lookin' at it from this angle
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Answer the question, Patrick
Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Yeah.  I guess.
What?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
Yeah.
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Chief says...
You never learned how to speak my language.
How did you manage it?
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
What did they say about Granada before today?
Surely you can do anything you want.
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
You think I don't know that?
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
Where are we going?
You bring the cigarettes?
Back in the Czech Republic?
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Divorced.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
Pouring it out!
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
End my career?
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
A timer.
Stay with her.
What are you saying?
Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Stay here.
But what if it does?  You might need my help.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
Raw deal.
So am I.
You know what I'm saying here.
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
How many victims are up there?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Is it drug related?
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
I have five-hundred dollars.
Is there a problem?
Two weeks.
He doesn't speak English.
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Don't speak Russian!
We have no money.  Come on.
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Ha. Ha.
You've got a call.
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
Aren't you tired?
Not good.
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
She's wonderful.
Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
It's possible.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
But not completely inconceivable?
I guess not.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Well, what is it?
In three days, darling, I hope.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
Thank you very much, Hal.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
You're gonna help us take him.
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
I'm helpin' you, huh?
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
Jesus.
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
No class...
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
I'll keep it in mind.
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
Who gives a fuck what you think?
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
I still don't think it's loaded.
What's wrong with that?
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
How would you know?
Shut up.
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
Sure, right.
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
You know exactly where they are!
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
She dropped in on me... holding this.
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
Perfect.
Hey bud! Finger here.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Take them and put them in a safe place.
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
...Ma???
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
You have nine points left on your license..
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
Found it?
Does it get any better or what!
Yeah, very big, a giant.
I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...
Got it...
Not without Leeloo.
I'll be right back.
What mission?
To save the world.
You're the only one left alive...
You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
Uh..you're welcome.
You get that off the screen?
Protect life... Until death.
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
Been here long?
An elephant couldn't crack it.
Amen..
Do you know how much I missed you?
Your clothing reeks of it.
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
... What's going on?
Don't...
Nobody knows anything.
I want to watch you work.
I'll consider it.
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Any good?
Eddie.
Yeah, who's this?
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
How'd you find me here?
Who is Machine?
I want his name.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
Something like that.
Fuck you!
I'm listening.
Of what sort?
Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Pardon me?
I'll risk it.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
I'm a working stiff, pops.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
Thank you.
You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
He succeeded.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
I told you I can't, not yet.
The checks were for odd amounts...
Okay, I follow you so far...
You told me to look, so I looked.
No.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
Of course.
Will you let me look?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
Yes.  I remember her.
No, sir, he is not.
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Okay.  Fine.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
It was bad.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
I know.  Uh...Alice.
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
It's okay, we're just about there.
Alright, I think I see salvation...
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
She doesn't want me around
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
You disappointed in me?
I've got to go.
Now.
What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
Yeah...
Mark...
And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
Helen.  I appeal to you -
Huh?
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
Something wrong?
Why do you say that?
High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
I met Dr. Kent, once.
I'll be another!
Toward the Pole!
No. Black.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
No.
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
I hear Twombley got shot.
No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
You might not kill it.
Mmm.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Shit.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
I don't care. They're out.
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
What are you talking about?
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
I want to go home.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Huh?
Like hell.
So?
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
I won't. You interested?
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
The key, Wade.
I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?
Did you get his number?
Good. Who?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
It's nice.
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Where... how'd you hear that?
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
You and me.
Crawl!
There was something. It happened up your way.
Huh?
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
That it wasn't an accident.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
Not particularly.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
Yeah, no duh.
No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
I'm doing what I can.
Because it is my duty.
About goddamn time.
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Jim...
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
They've gotta be joking.
Gravity.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
The fax machines.
But this is different, sir. You're the President.
Twenty-five years.
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
Commissioner.
What's the story?
I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Elaine, we have to go back.
Elaine, what's going on?
Now!
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
I think so.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
That's okay, ROK.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Poached!  Not over!  Over!
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Don't try to stop me!
No.  I mean your relationship.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
No. I'm all alone.
Something about a plane with no pilot?
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
Well...not for another two hours.
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
A hospital? What is it?
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
I love you, Elaine.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
And a little ice!
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
Hello.
You promise you'll write.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Yes, Captain?
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
Thank you.
You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.
I like my horizons narrow.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
Here?
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Did you talk to him?
Your mother mates out of season.
Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
Was.  Divorced.
Ta ss'trakyona'...
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Sure.  Just a minute.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
What?
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Say again?  All after incinerators?
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
Proceed inside.
Yes, Hicks?
Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
No.  Have you?
Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
So what do I tell this guy?
Terrible.
Why not?
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Sweet Jesus.
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Humiliated?
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Why? People fart backwards.
Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!
Well, ask her!
What?
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Oh, Stanzi.
Why not?
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
Originals?
Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
I was at hand.
He needs me, ma'am.
He asked me to stay.
In three months! Papa.
Adorable!
Michael!
Ah, now! Here she comes.
May I try it?
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Really?
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
What is it?
Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
I will.
I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
Good morning, sir.
Do any pupils come to the house?
I don't know. He has pains.
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
That kind of music should be punishable by death.
I liked the horse.
Put it down!
No.
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
Ah!
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
How could it not, Excellency?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
How much?
This is only a vaudeville.
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
What?
I'm too young to be so sick.
No! No, it's him!
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
We ended in F Major?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Please! Just one moment.
Yes!
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
Certainly, Herr Director.
Who is on this committee?
Baron!
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
No? Was Mozart a good man?
Yes?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
Exactly.
Yes, in the third act.
What? Who the devil are you?
Well, promise then.
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Can we come in?
Yes, Doctor.
He said 'Jack'.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
Dr. Hirsch?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
I beg your pardon?
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
What?
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
Will you think about it?
Not just a patient -- me.
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
Bathroom.
That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
Yeah, I do, but go to work.
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
David, stop!
No.
No.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Has he been refusing food?
There's no call for that kind of language.
That's what I want you to do, you moron!
Oh, come on, tell us.
Bambi?
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
So they said.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
I really don't know.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Okay.
You ask them.
Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
What was it?
A coyote.
No, but he was on the moors.
Are you going to help me up?
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
I'm not listening!
Shut up, you zombie!
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
How shall I do it?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
No.
And what, Sergeant?
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
What good will that do?
I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
Get out, get out!
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
Well, what?
No.
I want to be near you!
Cyril!
Thank you!
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Yes, sir.
Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
No, sir.
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
You're protecting somebody.
What are you talking about?
Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
He's at a board meeting.
Oh, you think I'm lying?
All right, dear.
Yes, sir.
It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know.
Huh?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
wasn't anywhere near this place—
Yes.
I guess so.
Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
I ain't done --
He's not bad at it.
Tomorrow.
Two.
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
What's going on?
What is wrong with you?
What will be?
You're forgetting who's in charge --
Pass me some whisky.
Me get heap firewater --
My little Web did that?
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
If I could go back to farming --
Jim was old enough...
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
No! I mean, of course not. No.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
What?
If you don't see it, it's not real...
Yes ma'am.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
I think so.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
I swear.
I just though you were awful cute.
They had to be dealt with!
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
What is going on here, man?
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
I demand action.
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
On a lot of lithium?
Eight?
Yes, dear.
Is it a what?
I'm ignoring you.
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip –  to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
You and...Luis?
Yes?
Would you like to see my apartment?
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.
But what about the past? Our past?
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Lucky, I guess.
It looks so soft.
Patrick?
I guess you're right...  THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
Just say no?
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Dorsia is...fine.
You didn't give them a name.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Hmmmm.
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
Hello 
Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Who do you ask?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
Nothing.
Don.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Great, yes, I'd like that.
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
Where was Marcus?
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
I'm so hungry.
I'm hungry.
Al.
Speak up. Come on.
Shhhh...it's okay.
It's...it's...all right.
Oh well, you know.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Yes, Owen?
Is that a raincoat?
You don't wanna move, do you?
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
No way. You have this -- destiny.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
What're you -- what?
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
I remember.
Don't we have any chopsticks?
I am. I am, sir.
Yes sir.
What'd they ever do for you?
Oh hi.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
Nothing!
I'm sure.
The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
Longitude 109 --
Just do it.
I mean, it's your life.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
Got out of my other commitment.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
Let's get him in here.
Why's that?
But why would they --?
Oh yeah?
They'd frame him.
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
You mean -- break in?
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
I don't know.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
There is no public offering. The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this just to run their web site.
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
You may.
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
Care for some saki?
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
Oh, and Austin...
Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
There's one more thing, Austin.
Excuse me?
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Well, you can't always get what you want.
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
My wedding tackle.
I'm sorry?
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
I couldn't have another bite.
Oh, yes you are.
She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.
Not in the Nineties.
Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
Yes.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
Are you crazy?
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
That's not mine.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
Shut up.
Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
They're mutated sea bass.
People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
Really?
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
... preserve...
Impossible?
If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
Rules are made to be broken.
Hmmm ...
Looks like rain, Steed...
Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
You mean my other self ...
She had this in her mouth. There, there...
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
What kept you?
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're very beautiful.
Half-brother to be precise.
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
Global warming?
Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody.  I expect you'll like her.
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Why?
I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
She was ...
No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
When do the girls get to the party?
What is this person's story here?
Fan out and look for them.
Mr. Thomerson.
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
But a fabulous cook.
Are you going to have women at your party?
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
Um... that's very relaxing.
Can't I just go with you guys?
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Rick, you're lying!
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
Yes...
A real turd.
Screw you...
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
It's Bullwinkle.
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
Debbie.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
Yeah...
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
Not likely.
It worked when you were in sixth grade.
That was never proved.
-- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
C'mon, let's crawl home.
Just leave me alone, okay?
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
Huh.
How's it going?
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Got anything to drink in there?
Then why did you quit?
Leave Stephen out of this --
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
You're right.
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.
I don't guess.
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Engine 115, right?
Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
It's in my blood, Willy.
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
Well, let's have a look.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
You can't keep being his father...
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
He works for me.
I know you.
Absolutely.
No Marty, I don't.
Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
Who?
You mean you could use it.
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
How about 7 1/2?
There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
Please.
Yeah, him.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
What's your name?
Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
Did we get our bill yet?
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
Go on.  Good so far.
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
I want to speak with you.
It's been a long time.
Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.
Your father is proud of you.
Nobody told me anything.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
Which one is your brother?
I don't want to hear it.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
I didn't mean it to sound like that.
The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Peerless, last time, go see your father.
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!
...no, she didn't...
...then what about...
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
You don't read, do you?
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Aw, c'mon.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
Your honor must lower his voice.
As you please.
For whom else have you worked?
I have faced that problem before.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
How so?
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
Yeah, if you've slept.
I'm not telling you what happened.
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
Yeah --
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
How do you know that?
The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Bullshit.
Look in my pack.
You're lying --
Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
From up close or far away?
We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.
Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
MAYBE WHAT --
What kind of trouble are you in?
Tell me what I can do.
And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
Yeah.
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Move him.
Why?
Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?
Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
You're off to a late start.
Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
What?
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
That bugs you too?
You wanted to get the truth.
Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.
Want company?
Yeah.
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
I don't think I want to hear this --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
Fifty minutes.
You can't threaten me --
So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
Yes!
Edward Bloom.
Not yet.
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
How would you describe him?
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
I see. I thank you for your time.
I never knew.
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
Karl.
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
You mean, while I'm here.
Yes.
I think someone hasn't.
Can we talk?
The River!
How did you get so many?
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
There is no softer ground than town.
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
You don't have to.
I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
Is he going to be okay?
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Yes. Thank you.
There's over eighty thousand here.
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
Do you want to stop?
We'll stop then.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
I'm asking what you're here for.
Good. 
Right.
No. It is too judgmental.
Tell me what he said.
Do you believe in love?
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Leave her alone.
Yes.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
It's makes it easier. Okay.
In every sense. If at all possible.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
What?
What? No you're not..
Have you got your passport?
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
Sometimes.
Why?
So now you hate all women?
I don't have nothing.
What?
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
Please. Why not?
Goodbye.
No. What? No. I know.
Just wanted to see.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
You take her to a doctor?
No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what to do.
I put on the lotion you got me. Can you smell it?
You gonna sing me somethin'?
I need ya help again.
Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
That's not right, really, cuz I...
You joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself. Army'd pay for school. You were gonna get a degree, maybe somethin' in business or agriculture and you were gonna make somethin' of yourself.
The only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her.  Your first night away, I come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. You weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. Like she was havin' some kind'a fit.
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
I begged him not to go. And he did.
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
What?
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
God saw to it to put you in my path. And I aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
Uh-uh.
To freedom.
I ain't in a hurry.
I guess you have.
Looks like you know a song.
I know that.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
Naw!
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
What's that chain around her for?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah?
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
All that shit's on aisle 5.
Eh, if the bootie fits...
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Thanks.
Charlie...
Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
Hey, when in Rome --
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
What'd she say?
That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai.
Cool?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
You'll take care of that.
Give me a break, would you?
Where would you look for the mafia?
I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Are we getting married?
Ichiro --
You were too far behind.
Let's go.  Him first.
Call for help.
We can't lose.
How can you be so sure?
You have a helluva way of answering.
Unavailable.
You could fake it.
He drinks.
Time, I've got plenty of.
Why me?
I planned on catching him, Captain.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
He killed a police officer.
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
You trust me?
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
You underestimate the trap, Mary.
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
I am?
Well, actually
You're androids.
Like what?
His company made us.
When?
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
She's not with you?
And what in your estimation works?
It's okay.  Forget it.
Vodka!
Thank you very much.
Prosit.
I don't know.
Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
Sorry.
Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
What did she want?
What night?
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
You mean the snake.
Sorry.
I bet I would.
Why should I be?
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
Yeah.
Right.
Dead.
Yeah.
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
But then how can you...
What's a long time?
Ten years.
No, I don't.
Just wait here.
But how come I'd be there?
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
Oh.
He's really funny!
Really?
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
Get away from me!!
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
I can't, it's yours.
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
Watching television in color.
Sorry.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
Why?!
And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
Thank you.
I told you I've never driven before!
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
Sure.
That's boring!
Okay!
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
How 'bout this one?
Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
Did you?
All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
Eve, I'm sorry.
And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
What?
I know first aid!
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
My pleasure.
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
Yes, it is.
Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Gerade aus dann links!
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Why?
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Yes, father?! Yes?
That's what everybody believes?
Amazing. I'm very impressed.
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
What?
You don't look thirty-five.
How old do I look?
The sky!!!
The sky?  Where?
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
It's safe.
I'm not hungry.
How could you?! This is just like home!
I told you! I've got everything!
I've noticed.
Hi.
Yes...
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
Yes.
I want him to at least see the sky!
You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
Oh, my God...
Those sluts!
Yes, you do!
Coward!
Yeah! That's thinking.
Stand by. One.
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Why do you do it?
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Jeffrey.
Nobody.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
See my nipples?
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
Do you know?
You don't?
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Who's it, you mean.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Yes.
What do you want?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
Does that scare you?
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
I think I better go.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
It's okay. It's okay.
My secret lover.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Hello, daddy.
From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh? You wanta go for a ride?
Speak to me Fucker.
Do you see, Ben? I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
What kinda beer do you like?
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
That's too bad.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Maybe so.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
I don't know.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Alright.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
Oh, okay, can I call?
Are you sure?
What did you see?
He got a little jealous.
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
Okay, okay.
You want to go talk to him?
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Yeah.
Frank!!!
Dorothy Vallens?
Go ahead!
Your dad and I used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. Believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. He is... a fuckin' monster.
Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
Yes.
Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
C'mon!
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
BLAME...
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Be careful.
Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it.
Then what the fuck?
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
Pee...Per...Man.
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
And the pennies?
New hitman wants to leave his mark
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are you?
You sure you killed them?
Well, I'm sold.
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
God's permission? God doesn't...
Yes.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
He's a nigger.
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the fuck down!
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
This is he?
Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
What do you think the cops have?
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
That sets it off.
Hang on a second.
What do you think?
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
I don't want to use it.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
Maybe he just went to the store.
Where was I?
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
If you say so.
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
We've got sixteen dollars.
$383.
What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the --
Ah. Couple days ago.
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
Who's Mr. Henry?
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
Hang on a second.
Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
Applejack! What's happening?
Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
I'll see you there.
What?
There's not enough time.
Yeah.
Nothing.
Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
Hold it.
What do you mean?
The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
That sounds like Dignan.
I don't want to die.
I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank.
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.
I hear you're a good thief.
The front stairs.
Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
Not even for emergencies?
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
Let's just go.
Did we get it?
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
Good luck, since I got the keys.
Let's go.
I know it, man. Hang on.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
I didn't think there was an alarm.
What's that?
Here we go.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Oh, yeah.
Why?
Well, I think --
Who? Applejack?
What can we do?
Where's that guy going?
Fight. You know.
You Hoto?
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
Save it for Bourne.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
Why not? It was just money.
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Keep going...
I speak English.
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
I don't know.
-- my coat -- but we should --
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
What if it's not who you think it is?
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
What do you mean?
Are you disappointed?
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
So?
Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we?  Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et --  ...It was Malcolm's favorite.
He has already agreed to come.
He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
But if we have not caught Wallace --
So I did! And what was so important about it?
Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.
Aye.
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
I rest.
It's up to us, Hamish!
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
Thank you for accepting.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
I need you so much! I love you!
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
Peace is made is such ways.
She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
So what did you find.
Um... can dad come this time?
Great. I'll see you soon.
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Weirder than this?
So you believe me?
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
Hi, Lenny.
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
So how's Tommy?
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
What do you want to know, Evan?
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
Now's the only time!  Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
You're kidding. He's so... big.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
So you decided to go to America.
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
Goodnight.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
I'd better be going.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
I will.
We said "no questions."
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
I don't think I will, Rick.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
Put them on the table.
For the last time, put them on the table.
When did you first find out he was alive?
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
How do you do?
Thank you. I try.
I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
Yes, I get the point.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
Yes.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Very well.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
May we proceed with the business?
This is hardly the time or the place.
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
Huh?
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
Go ahead, Ricky.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
I haven't the slightest idea.
For how long?
You ever going to bed?
No.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Good. Then have a drink.
The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
Catch another fish tomorrow.
With what?  There's nothing to fix it with.  This rope comes undone, you're going to drown.
No.
Water water water --
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Yeah.  A long time ago.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
I thought you might have.
My epitaph.
There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
No.
I'm touched.
Baloney.  I do see the damn "big picture."
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
For all those vacation days you got coming.
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
Want to see my raft?
I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
To life.
I need to do it.
Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you.
May I ask, where are you bound?
San Francisco.  And you?
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether.
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Daddy, *please*...
Oh...
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
Okay...
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
He's *paralyzed*!
She knows how to take care of herself.
Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago.  I've been through this.
I never said they were boring.
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
But did you know him?
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
What's an immigrant?
Someone not from Maine.
Is that soon?
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
Oh, I would love that, Wally.
Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself "not a doctor"!  Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble.
It's my turn!
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?
Of course.
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
Right.
Almost.
But you don't look very happy.
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? *Half* of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well *step* on 'em, too--they only good for cider.
Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
What's lucky about that?
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
This has to happen fast.
Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
The Anti-Christ?
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
She walked.
So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three...
So what? We hide, right?
People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
Let's go, Jake?
So what? We just stay clear of him.
I told you, use less powder.
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
You sure?
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
I think two million.
Good boy.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
You interested in a little work?
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
Then show me how.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
Did I miss something?
Do you have something to prove?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
WHAT?
I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that?
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
No, I want my cut!
You better get over to Al's. Now.
Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
What was it?
I'm sorry.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
Stand up.
A Fed? Is he close?
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
You guy's are not working with me here. I just got off the phone with my boss. After he got done ripping me a new Lincoln Tunnel size asshole, he let me know exactly how little I'm welcome back if we come up short. And now here you guys are, WASTING MY FUCKING TIME!
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
How do I look?
No. Thanks.
My car's in the garage.
I'll take you up on that.
All men are cheats.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
What's the Blue Book price?
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
I want a job, Giles.
Who was he?
She.
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
I hope it brings you luck.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit!
Then what?
Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple.
No.
Well, thank you anyway.
Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
Absolutely not.
I don't gamble.
I didn't.
What kind of trouble?
I know that. But you can now.
Yes.
No thank you.
She's my baby.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
And the girls?
"The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." Ernest Hemingway.
Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight.  Hey, you haven't changed your clothes!
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
Give me 365.
They've been tested.
I don't think so.
What for?
I don't gamble.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
Yeah.
Look, bomb...
Fuck that shit.
Pinback, throw me the chart log.
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
But how do you know you exist?
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
Mafhkin oble groop...
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
Fred.
Who cares?
5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
What happened, Doolittle?
It didn't work?
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
How I make my living, what's your point?
What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
No.
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
I don't get involved with guns.
SHHH!  Don't do that!
I know.
First time I ever heard that.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
Logan Cale.
Lauren's not my wife.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
C'mere, I want to show you something.
How much do you know?
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
That's deep.  But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
Any idea when she'll be back?
A friend of your fiance's.
To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
Look, I don't know what you want--
I understand.
Right here someplace.
Nothing on Hannah?
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
Straight.
You know what I'm saying.
How long you and me known each other?
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
Okay...idea.  Compromise, right?  Bruno here comes with me.  He holds the money until mommy shows up, then we close escrow.  What you do with her after I'm gone doesn't keep me awake nights.
Tell everybody hey.
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
And why should she?
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
--a philandering pig.
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize.
One more time in English.
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
Nah. Couldn't be.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.
Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Look, you can have my wallet...
Neither do I!
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
Are you AFRAID?
Did you know him?
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
Infant Memory Generators.
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
What's wrong with you?
Then when? I have to talk to you.
Hey. You OK?
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
I know I'm not the best... communicator.  But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool.  But what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them.
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
I think about girls a lot.
I asked you about school.
How does that make you feel?
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Soon. Time is almost up.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
It is a big deal.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
She's right over there.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
Really, Loretta?
There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
Airport Ho-Jo!
I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Yah?
Oh-you-beccha.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
This, this... This is bullshit!
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Yeah...
Loretta, shut it.
You don't know where this is gonna...
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
That's right.
Yeah.
What?
Wisconsin.
Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha!
Nothin' too showy!
Y'betcha, Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
Harold!
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
Take a letter.
"My President"...
Never mind then, I'll get in touch with him myself -
Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here.
All right -
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
Oh, yes, I remember -- and I should have slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face when she told it to me... I'm going right out and find Trentino.  You go right out and get yourself an army.
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
Anything else? 
Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it.  I will stay here in Freedonia.
Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
You upstart!
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
Oh -- you mean... worm?
No, that wasn't it...
That's it...
These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
Let him patch up his own breeches...
Now -- er --
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
I've always thought that myself.
That I am very little different from him.
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
He must have taken quite a fall.
It's quite nutritious, sir.
No, more of an acquaintance.
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
...Yes, Sir.
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
y-y-yes--
Oh, yes.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
Yyess.
My name is...
Hello, my name is John Merrick.
Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright?
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
Pardon me?
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
What?
But surely you know...?
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
What was she like?
But you LOVED her all the same...
"The fifth one this week"!
No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
There is something I must ask the Gods...
SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
You've got to let me go!
Don't talk nonsense.
Yes... oh, yes...
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
But...
What?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Sorry.
The sun! That's it!
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
No, don't say anything else!
What are you talking about?
I was sitting there.
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
Over the Edge of the World.
Let me do something for myself for a change!
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
Got you!
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
Help!
She knows it was our fault!
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Yes?
Probably see you at the book store.
You're sure? It's cold.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
I like to read.
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
Cheers.
Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
You pick it.
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
Thanks.
I think so.
No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Would you get me another, Joely?
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
Naomi, I guess.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
Well, you're married.
Not yet. Not married.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
Yeah, like that.
What do we do?
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
yeah?
I love her.
I think she's great.
Me too. There's this poem --
Female.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
I love you.
Tomorrow?
Joel, come here. Please.
That's okay. I --
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
What? What do you mean?
What?
It's not somebody else.
I miss you.
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
I better do this, Stan.
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
It's a good one all right.
Yeah.
Nothing.
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Is that Nietzsche?
It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Just wanted to let you know.
She was unconscious, Patrick.
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
Siwash, huh?
I'm staying with the Countess.
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
Like what?
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
So now you're bummin' around?
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
The containment, Second Containment...
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
Oh God...
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
What does?
The dark inside me.
Yes, sir!
Skipper, you gotta help me...
Justin. I won't let you die.
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Do it.
The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
Yes...
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?
Better if I just show you.
Come around to three-three-four...
We're all here.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
Do it. Dr. Weir...
No. I'll be right back.
He's been past Mars?
They're explosive charges.
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
The forward airlock.
I like the sound of that.
I mean...
Victor must've taken him.
Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
Where do you think? With Sue.
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Youthful high spirits.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
O-kay. We'll skip that question.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Go back to the drawing board.
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
Not this again --
What about you?
You've been working out.
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Oh, it is.
Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
But Johnny... you can't fly.
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
And that's a good thing?
I was talking about us. Working together.
We need to get past them.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
Why didn't you say something?
So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
Reed, we're running out of time.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
You want to work at Carl's?
How much did they cost?
Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
They're not home yet.
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
But your face did!
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it.
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
What? Now?
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Get going.
You should work for yourself.
Did you get her name?
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
Did you go home and get it?
No Damone. I don't understand.
Whatever you say, Rat.
Sensitive -- what is that?
Not if you're over sixteen.
Fascinating.
He is.
They're fuckin' with us.
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
What's the big deal?
There's nothing to it.
You'll always remember your first time.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Yes.
The point sounds fine.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Do you want to come inside?
Naw. I don't mind.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Sure.
Oh. I see.
What about the notes?
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
A major!
That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy.
That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
Don't worry...  ...and I'm actually the District Attorney from Ignoto County.  Just another good American like yourself.
Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close.
You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
The cops?
In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
Part of what?
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
Spare me.
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
We're lucky to be alive.
Where's that?
There's a tunnel.
Get in line!
No. You?
My truck.
What?
Just cover me. It was built to move.
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
Will I go crazy or something?
It's much safer in there, sweety.
How much you got?
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
He shot you the other time.
Good.
What?
Keys.
If he doesn't shut up...
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
That's one piece of four problems.
I'm fine, I really am.
Oh...
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
Well...
I just hit it like you said.
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
A rich actress.
Right now we have to be practical.
I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it.
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
Be careful, Francie.
But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
But, Kurt, I...
Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
Occupation?
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Harry.
You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
...So you think I should go.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
What?
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
No, they don't, do they?
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.
Calm down, Frances.
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
I'll bet.
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
Will you marry me?
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
I'll be back.
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
But what -- 
Excuse me.
Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... 
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
Oh for Christ's...
No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders...  ...and your pencils...  ...and your god-damn buttons...  ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!
No! No!
Good! Because, Brothers, that's you!
You're kidding.
It can't be as bad as that.
Worse.
Friends? Do they live around here?
You speak.
Kill you? Hardly that.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
There is something I want.  A friend.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
And if I consent?
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
I'll be waiting. And watching.
There, there... shhh...
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
I give you my soul...
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
I do. But you must trust me for now.
I have been waiting for this ever since.
Aye, Captain.
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
No. He had more important work.
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
I didn't find what I was looking for.
And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
Of Geneva.  Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine? Or mysticism?
I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
Un-hunh.
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.
I have no idea.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face.
Richie, take the keys. Start that big bastard up, and drive it up front.
She's dead?
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
Real McCoy.
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
Mexicans.
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
Me too.
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
Whatsamatter?
Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
Gotcha!
No.
I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos and his boys will escort us to El Ray and --
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
What?
Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now.
I did?
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
You know what you look like?
Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.
That's what I hear.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
None at this time, sir.
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
Same rules for everyone, sir.
"We'll all have lunch."  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!
West?
Hey.  Ain't your call, man.
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Yes, dear.
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
I can make this wall without --
You're wanted at the C.O.'s.
Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
Thanks, Wick.
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
They had to kill 'em?
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
This is insane.  You've got no proof.
Educate her, Pyro.
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
Should I be afraid?
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
I think you're the liar.
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil?
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Say again?  How many micks?
15, sir.
Your new roommate.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
Women.
I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
Well, I can be tough if I want.
Nearly four years...
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
Nesting?
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Who is he?
Nick Tatopoulos.
I left my forgery kit back at the office.
I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.
Five bucks.
You're kidding, right?
This is not the place...
Not now. You got my bag?
Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
We? I don't think so.
I don't think so.
They didn't make it.
That is our job.
Get your people out of there or I will.
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.
But you don't know for sure!
Oh.
I need you to trust me.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
Where are you?
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
...Yes sir.  Your quarters sir.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
I won't and nothing you say-
...Damn you!  Damn you!
Am I crazy, or do you actually have something there?
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
The guy is terminally selfish!
Why didn't you stop at the market?
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
To see if there's a pub.
Yes but, we were wondering-
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Okay, that's where you want to be.
What does the Omega 13 do?
But you don't?
How did you come to that conclusion?
Shit! Go!
What?  Up?
Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
There is no weather in space.
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
You... know us?
No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
Guy... You probably don't remember me do you?   I was on the show in '82.  Episode 31?  Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial?  "Crewman #6?"
Where'd they go? Back inside?
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...
I don't think that's a cloud...
Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
Do you think I'm a fool? That the Commander does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship?
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
A model, only as big as this.
Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  I can show you on a map.
Oh god...
Tommy, we have these...
Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
And a French alliance?
I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
While they're strung out?
There, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial.  Benedict, trust me to handle this.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
We've got powder but no ball!
Therefore, retreat.
Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
To hell with Arnold...
March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
Well, if it's my last order, then I order them to be there!  Tell them I will give them my decision then.
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
General Lee is detained captain...
The British army, sir!
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
They help me understand why we fight.
What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
Get these men back in line!
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
Martha!  For God's sake!
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
I don't want to see your hospital.
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
Yessir!
Yes, I thought that's how you'd feel, Nathanael.
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
"Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."
Well, we must be who we must be...
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
He was not black!  He was... tan! Weathered!
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
Who?
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
No. What's this?
Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
Leo, I don't know.
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.
Depends. Who's this?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Look at me, Ray.
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
You have a card in here?
Not yet. I just started.
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
Leo spanked a waitress?
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
Come on, Harry -– Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
Fuckin' basketball game.
The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
With what? Wiseguy money?
That's not bad. I think you got it down.
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
Don't go out of your way.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
That's what the guy said.
What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them.
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
What? You sure?
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
Wrong. It's Friday.
Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.
Bring it on, dude.
So we kill him?
Then what the hell happened to him?
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
Why not?
What?
If you get it back in one piece.
Turbine rotor's shot.
Three, four days.
Goddamit, Dodge.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
It looks like it.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
Murphy.
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Then you're a lucky man.
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
Lights?
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
Nope.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
Somebody took it out of commission last night.
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.
Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
We could call for help.
Maybe.
All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was.
What's this?
That cost me twenty grand at least.
Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying.
Guess.
Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?
Hello...
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
Uh-oh.
Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
No.
So, where's "Weird Al"?
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
I just stopped in to say hi.
Yeah, right...
Then why do you hate me so much?
How long have you been up?
Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
That lets us off the hook.
Okay, okay!
You loser!
Oh, we totally have to.
No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine.  There! Look at her!
Oh yeah.
What does it stand for?
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back.
JOSH!
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Should we leave a note?
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
What? Where?!
If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
Don't worry.
So should I come over?
What are you talking about? Who?
Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow.
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid. 
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Well, we won't keep you.
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
Seymour does.
Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?
I did too!
Hey, where are you going?
God, fuck you!
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
Oh, right...
I'm totally serious!
Yeah, well...
Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want?
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
Don't you trust me, Seymour?
Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
YAAA!
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
Sounds good...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
Can you at least let me in?
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
What?
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
No... forget it...
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
Yeah, well... me neither...
They're Seymour's.
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
I wish I could see him.
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
So work must be going well?
Yes he is.
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
Then why do you stay?
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent. 
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
You mean nobody died?
We all worked together. Worthy deeds were accomplished. I liked the labor.  My mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands.  I like the blood, is that strange?
We need to talk.
Has it ever done that before?
I'll be bait alone?
Because I think they're after you.
This is more difficult-
Nonsense.
Oh yes. But it takes time.
I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.
Once... 
We don't have a relationship.
Do you ever see him?
Occasionally
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Didn't I do it?
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
Okay, let's take a look.
Good-bye, Peter.
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
Now you're talking.
What are you doing up here?
Then why have you come?
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.
Yes, the scourge --
Who are they?
Maybe they just want to appeal.
Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
I don't even want to know where that is.
They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
Good idea.
This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
Now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear."
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
What's the matter, dear?
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
All right, what happened to me?
So what do you think it was?
That's a violin concerto.
Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
Then leave.
All right.
Goodbye.
Can't you tell me now?
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Great!  How's it going?
Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
That's "Peck!"
Sorry.  This isn't your day.
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
I'm always serious.
Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
Yeah, I can smell it.
It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.
Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.
That appears to be the case.
I don't know.  Talk to it.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
I don't think it's Shandor.
Mmmhmmm.
Do you believe in God?
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Oh, stay...  Don't you want to join the chorus of praises for Narcissus' glory?  Just remember, he is a married man.
Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
Send them out!
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?
That this illness has clouded his mind.
We have to stop the Germans now!
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
I'll nose around...
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
Greeks?
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
I'm a Greek, thank you.  And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians.  Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white.  Relax, tell me everything, I'm your friend.
Death is a very light thing for you.
-- to fight?  We'll see...
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
You get to come alive again in the country!
Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.
Hello.
No.
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
No.
No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
What?
That woman. The older woman.
Oh my God --
Don't cry. 
Get out of here.
Elaine -- I love you.
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
I don't understand.
Will you kiss me!
When?
You mean you're confused?
I have to go back now.
Yes.
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Hello -- who is this?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Are you listening?
It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
What for?
Well here's the purse.
Could you bring it up?
Benjamin?
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
A single. Just for myself, please.
Where is your luggage?
It's down the hall.
What?
I'm very neurotic.
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
All right. Now finish your drink.
What is wrong with me?
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
Don't you think he trusts us together?
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Do you want me to get it?
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
To tell you?
Benjamin.
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
Is this -- what?
Well what do you want to talk about?
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
What novel did you read.
I don't remember.
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
Oh my God.
No.
I was just kidding around.
Good.
No.
You're not.
You're goddamn right I am.
Did I say that?
Go home now.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
Thank you.
Quite a while.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Yes, sir.
Oh yes.
I will.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Yes.
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
Time's getting short.
No -- no -- no -- no...
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
What about the money?
You?
Dictation.  You know...
No -- why? -- should I?
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Where downstairs?
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
I want to be alone.
Yes.
Shall I see you again?
Oh -- yes but -- later.
I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
I can't.
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
All right then.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
Everything?
Have you seen the bathroom? -- Hot and cold running water -- You see, I can get a bath whenever I like.
To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock. 
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
Yes.
You're trembling.
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
Yes --
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
I'm the stenographer.
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
Exactly.
Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
Oh!
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
The performance -- the performance -- the performance. 
Again?
I could not think of not accepting.
Go away -- go away.
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
Madam Grusinskaya's car.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
What's bluff?
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
My son --
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
You brought a case? Good.
Hello.
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
They twisted my arm.
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
That's right.
What?
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.
Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
In your other hand.
Taking you for granite?
That's just Lilly's way.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
I'll sign that affidavit.
What?
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
I've heard the name.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
What happened to Cole?
Upstate.
Oh, come here.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
Pretty messy.  Parents have already been notified.  Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
No shit?!
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
I was trying to get away from someone.
Yes.
John...
Then I'll get caught.
I'm okay.
Yeah.
Okay... thank you.
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
It's not going to happen.
Doesn't make it bad advice.
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
What are you looking at?
Are you going to leave, too?
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.
What if it's Kara?
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
What makes you think he'll come here again?
Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Here.  Let me try.
Wait a minute ...
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
It's a sign.  He's come home.
It was you.
No!!!
I'm gonna wet my pants.
No.
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
You know what gets me?
Let's talk about something else.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
She was always a rotten wife!  She was against everything manly you ever wanted to do.  He was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time, and his wife made him quit.  She made him become a life insurance salesman instead.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
That can be arranged.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
Sir?
Is anybody besides you here now?
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
I'll see.
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
She met him at college.
Dad was never in England?
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Will you go to bed?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Dad--
Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
We thought it was an emergency.
Nothing would please me more.
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm your husband.  Society approves!
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
Why not?
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
Did you like it, dear?
He knows you shattered his violin.
Blue soup?
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
I mean it!
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
Hundreds.
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
He's a champion after all. WOODLY Of the corpses and cripples you create for our instruction--when all we can learn from them is this: how cruel you are.
You're old--so old.
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
I'm utterly satisfied.
More clowning!  Don't you see?
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
It's trash now, like mine.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Premature ejaculation.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
He's a ghost!
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
I didn't know that.
To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
I don't get it.
What does he say to do?
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
That's something I suppose.
Something happens to my confidence.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
You figure!
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
How nice.
He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
I'm sorry.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
That you may discuss with the girl of your choice in the privacy of your room.
No, just not the type.
What are you doing?
Two officers have been assigned to the case. I can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead.
I just want to ask some questions.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
Well, I want to...
What?
Are you going to stiff me?
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
Okay.
I don't know no Tod.
I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
At least I'm a growing person.
Not very.
We're just alike. You think sex is so unimportant you don't do it. I think sex is so unimportant I don't care who I do it with.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
He deals in pain.
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
Fuck.
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
What happened?
I can't tell you that.
But then you'll forget about me.
Well, what do they know?
Who's paying you?
I'll be there.
What have you found out?
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
They are?
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
Does she know anything about this?
I'll come with you. Let me pack some things.
What?
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
That's not true, Mr...?
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
It's fifty cents admission. It's applicable to a purchase.
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
Yes, I am.
And what are you studying?
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
Oh, I don't have one.
Could I see your registration?
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Lady! Be quiet.
Maude???!
Eh, fine.
That's really great.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
Is he all right?
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
Thank you.
No more revolts.
I like you, Maude.
Pray? No.  I communicate. 
With God?
Well, be kind. I've lived a long time, Harold, seen evil as well as good, and it has been my experience that kindness...
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
Well, they're my species.
Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world.  What a joke it will be if like them I -
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
What?
You don't care! "Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!" Listen to me...
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
No. Like this.
And why is that?
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
A rough estimate.
No.
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
Another man's life in your sights.
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
Oh sure.
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
You knew?
I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised.
Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
Because I'm going to get my father!
I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.?
Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
Oh, I'll bet you have.
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
From where??!!
No. It was red. Bright red.
Is it bad?
The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence "Abe" Sapien.
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
My job.
Father's back?  Still angry?
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise?
Not from you.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
What -- ?
What?
Two steps back, please.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Oh, sod you.
We're leaving.
Sure.
Her mother's dead.
Who are you?
No!
What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
Oh.
Oh my God.
Who are you?
Frank.
What happened to you?
You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse...
Not know.
Let me see.
Hell...
No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.
The keys are in the kitchen.
This afternoon.
O.K. O.K.
Ah!
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
Maybe a brandy.
Please.
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
I won't be a moment.
I got through.
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
Well come over, will you? See the place?
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
Of course. Every day.
Call me tomorrow.
Yeah.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me.
Sure.
So lie down.
Oh no.
If I make it through the day.
'Bye.
I beg your pardon?
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
Play it.
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
What are you snickering about?
Ehh.
How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
My band.
Ooh.  Drag.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
I have a television.
Bullshit.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
Right.  Why?
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
Huh.  You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in.  You must have only been about sixteen.
Yeah, sure...
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now!
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
I suppose so.
Yeah.  Great.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
Is what better?  Better than what?
I haven't felt like it.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
Have you slept with him yet?
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
Ray.  I hate Ian.
You know I'm a good person.
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
No, no.  When are you going home?
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
Okay.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
No use.
Wanna go to dinner?
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
Not really.
I know.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
Hey.  It's Liz.
You called this morning?
-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
I knew this was going to happen.
But you must have --
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Nice.
Go to hell.
Thanks.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
The boy _died_?
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
Very traditional.
-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
I've been to Church Hill.
No.
I'd rather hear yours.
No one knows you're here?
Follow me.
At least.
Why are you here?
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
I'd like you to try.
He knows about you.
The inheritance.
Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
Call your mother.  You never call her.
What are you getting at, Moran?
What were you doing in Felton?
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Never take up poker, Detective.
Don't be stupid, lady.  Your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else's.
Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
-Auditorium nostrum-
Stop!
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
Why are you here?
You are the same?
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
This is madness!
Muy Bien!
It's like to kill me first.
If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
I do not think I like the sound of that.
You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
But why be so concerned about me?
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
I have no future husband.
Something pretty.
Don't threaten me, Private.
Must he go?
Yeah.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
Kahn?
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
Give me an address where I can forward Miss Cart- wright's head.
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
Did you know the victim?
American.
For the moment.
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
Just your pappy scared some.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
Well, congratulations! Good luck!
What's the idea of locking this?
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
Hello, Bensinger.
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
It doesn't have to rhyme!
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
Hello, Bruce...
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Just for the first year.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
The money? Why?
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
I have a lunch date. I just want --
No, I can't.
You've had a better offer, eh?
You bet I've got a better offer.
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
You -- you --
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
Now you got me.
What for?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Will you come here?
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Thanks.
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
Walter, you can't do that!
It'll be Heaven!
Take that mush out of your mouth!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
They can't do that to me!
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
I think it is.
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
Three sixes. Is that any good?
I can't complain.
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
What do I know about Williams?
Not this gun!
With a bag of marshmallows.
If you're talking about my brother- in-law, he's worked for the city fifteen years.
Fred!
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
I was just going to!
Editorials?
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end.
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
Keep away!
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
What's from the Governor?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
Yes, yes!
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
But how do I know...?
Come on, fellas.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
Looking for shrapnel.
Would.
It's not the same.
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
A bit too quick.
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
Why not?
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
And absent bridegrooms!
That's it.
Out.
Who said anything about love?
No, Mother! It's War! War!
Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel.
No, I told you...
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
OK.
Yeah, come on.
A dead one.
Do you believe this fucking girl?
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Now, what makes you think that?
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
You mean John Wayne?
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
Yeah.
Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
How much further?
Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
He won't move.
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
Man, it's already ten thirty.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
There's not enough room.
You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
Goddamn.
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
Grab Mary and come inside.
Tickets for what?
That seems likely.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
Tell me about it.
God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
Yep, I suppose it is.
What do they call you, sweety?
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
Aw, honey you know I can't do that.
You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
What!
Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner.
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
George Willis...  ...any leads?
Over here, inside the smokehouse.
Shit... fuck procedure.
I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
What.
Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
And?
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
You're fucked up, Lila.  Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake.
Gabrielle.
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
Oui.
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
Shit.  Hi, honey.
But I don't know how to leave Lila.
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes!
No.
I want to be the way I was before.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
What do you mean?
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
Really?
Rose, please go away.
Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?
With pleasure.
I'm really glad you two found each other.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
We are animals after all.
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
Do you?
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk.
I'll make it.  I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right?  Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink.  Voila!
How come?
Absolutely!
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Unka unka unka unka unka.
Yes?
Yep.
Pittsburgh?
No.
Check!
It's open...  What'll you have?
No, I'm fine.
I've never been to Louisville.
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
So I got talent. So what beat me?
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
A thousand.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
Now, when did you adopt me?
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
You hustlin' me?
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
I said we're leavin'.
I'm a businessman, kid.
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
What kind of straight pool game you like?
You well-heeled, partner?
I feel tight -- but good.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
You can't see it, can you, Charlie? I mean, you've never been able to see it. I came after him. And I'm gonna get him. I'm goin' with him all the way. The pool game is not over until Minnesota Fats says it's over. Is it over, Fats?
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
Okay, here...  Be a damn fool.
If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
For who, Mr. Findley? ...Bert, he only beat me by one point. Now, you can't get off me now.
Oh man, you're way out of our league.
Half and a dollar.
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Okay. So what's your name today?
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Oh, it's not bad.
Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
For how long?
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Shut up.
Nine ball.  Three ball.
You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
Yes.
Please.
Yes.
Why, Dad?
Because the sky is so clear out here.
Sure ... fine.
Better now, son?
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
Yes -- but ...
It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
Is that all he said?
Can you tell me about that?
Yes.
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
But it's not, Jimmy.
All their lines were busy.
I have school.
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
And the good news is you won't charge me.
That's the good news?
Checkmate.
Three years.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
Moishe, please, don't talk.
She should be shortly.
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Well, er... it's slowing down.
I'm a dancer.
No. Exotic.
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
We're leaving.
Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
Air... water... your "sun."
You are on your own?
All my life!
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
The Name of God...
I knew it was you --
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
You said go between them!
How do you know?
Out!
Dad, they come in through the doors.
Good point.
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
They want my diary.
You did!!
Are you kidding? -- I made that up! You know Marcus -- he got lost once in his own museum!
My lucky charm.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
Brody's this way.
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
We didn't talk. We never talked.
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
What did you find, Dad?
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
And why were you trying to kill me?
As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi.
When she saw the insects she passed out cold. I carried her back to her room. She was sleeping when I re- entered the tunnel to look around.
I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
You will go to palace there.
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!
What do you mean -- how?
It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
Somehow I feel safer in here.
First of all -- don't panic!
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?
I've never been so hungry in my life...
It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.
Quiet!
I'm going down.
You got it!
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
Figures...
Willie, come on!
I just got here.
Do me a favor, Al.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
Kill myself.
Are you crazy?
Hear voices don't I.
I'll talk to them.
Then what are you stopping for?
Why?
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
Just walk down the hall?
What does it say.
Black suits and helmets.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
I can't do that.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
...Just beautiful.
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
Are you screwing with any nerves?
What was?
You're out of shape.
Don't just stand there, say something.
What?
Where are you staying?
What?
To the hotel. To register.
Is something glinting?
But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
Who, me?
You got any books in there?
Why don't you get out of my face.
Osaka?
Follow her.
You think. That's what you're good at.
GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
About what?
I want to thank you for what you've done.
I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
Let us get to the border!
Who's our little man?
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
That crazy guy?
Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour.
He's not an ordinary man.
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Who...are you?
Fine. You look fine.
Here?
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
I feel fine.
Look, we'll bring your car home. just take it easy until the effects wear off. You need anything, just call this number.
This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.
What's what?
What did you say?
What?
...I'm looking for someone.
Yes, of course.
You're talking to me.
Who do you work for?
Is that Ryuji?
What do you mean?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
Who did?
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
Now what?
You are, I've seen you.
He told me what to do.
If he was able, what would he say.
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
What does he know?
You got a deal. 
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
P.J.'s.
I'll be there.
Push it.
What? Forget it.
I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
What do you mean, what's it do?
Because he has to reveal it in a court of law. It's on record, it's out. It's no secret anymore. So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? It's out in the world...
Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
Maybe later.
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
What about you, you got a crew already?
No, no, we're fine...
Well, at the end of the day... because of your segment... the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company... could own CBS.
You're sure you want to do this?
Why?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
I'm doing an interview.
An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry.
Use the bathroom.
Who's calling?
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
Yeah.
What are you and Mike going to do?
Jeffrey...
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
Alright?
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
Hardly new news.
Ordinary people! Under extraordinary pressure, Mike. What the hell do you expect? Grace and consistency?
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Good. I want to talk to you.
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
Hello, can you hear me now?
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
What do you mean there is no family?
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it. There are times I feel compelled to do it. If you asked me would I do it again? Do I think it's worth it? Yeah, I think it's worth it.
It acts as a drug on the body?
Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
Chapter and verse.
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
You threatening my family, now, too?
"Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
I just want to make sure that you both --
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
Who's the pigeon?
Excuse me?
Is that... one person?
Here's her picture...
Mr. Dumbarton.
It was a gift from a client.
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
What is your husband's profession?
What does your lawyer think?
How do you know?
I told you. I was hungry.
He wants a reconciliation.
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
Absolutely.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
No, that's not all.
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
Oh. And that is -- mom?
She held that against you?
Apparently she was very disappointed.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
Oh Miles!
I love you. I want to have your baby.
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
What do you want?
I want to nail you ass.
Hello Miles.
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Murder?
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
I wish I had your discipline.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
That's attorney client privilege.  Sorry, Miles. But as a great and clever man once said, What's good for the goose --
Rex, please.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer clerked for Scalia.
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
Miles.
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every day—whether it's coming to her or not.
I might.
I'll get it annulled.
You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember.  I'm sick of it!
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
Are you going to see him?
Certainly!  Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets.
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
Why should she? After all—
You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh?  All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me.  Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy.
What would you like to have me do?
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New York—and if we didn't go, she might lose it.
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
Hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Oh, yeah?
You win!
Well—of all the—well—  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
I never thought of that.
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but— you've been very kind. 
Oh, this?—I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Listen, Brat—I'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
Here—take mine.
I'll find it myself.
Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
I thought maybe—uh—"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
No. No. It's too good a story.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. I—I did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Well, you were!
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
This isn't "piggy-back."
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride—
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
What's got into you?
But what!
was so scared—that it scared—
You think it's simple, huh?
Never!  I'm going in and ask him—
A black eye. 
Left twenty minutes ago.
Husband?
Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything.  Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . .
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
But can't you wait until morning—
Okay. I was just trying to make conversation.
Oh, excuse me. 
You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed.
What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office—unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
Yes.
When you get through with that, I'll have a beard down to my ankles. 
That she's going to marry somebody else.
Well, I got it, Joe.
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarn—then something comes along—messes up the finish—and there you are.
Well, you got one now. —Come on, fill 'er up.
Collect?
That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.  Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Zeke.  Git!
What's the idea?
Say, Buddy–
Thanks. 
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with—
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Yeah. Just babies.
Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.
No!... Shaw!  Director of The Trade Mart?  This is incredible.
Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
You know you keep saying that.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
There's a word - orders.
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
Dave?
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
No, I never saw him before in my life.
And then Sunday?
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
And Shaw?
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
A rhinoceros.  Can I stay up another hour?
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
Who?
The Warren Commission call him?
Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Yes.
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
It never did. 
Never touched me.
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
Was he there often?
The assassination, Jack?
I just don't want to do it.  What else?
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
I mean it. I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries.
Three years.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
And you didn't tell the Police?
Hey, Jackie.
She wants to go back to work.
Beauty products.
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
Who do you think I am?
That doesn't sound dark.
It was the other guy who busted me.
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
It's not really something I think about.
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
Catching a movie.
What'd ya see?
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
Why?
They seem to like the idea.
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
Sit down, leave the bag under the table?
You think he's got a thing for you?
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
You're avoiding the question.
It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday.
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.
You never asked me if I did or not.
No.
How can you help us?
What are you doing?
What's her story?
Was she there?
We could, if I'm not in jail.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
Because I didn't have it. Ray, I swear, Melanie came in and grabbed it.  And someone killed her for it.
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag -- Is it tempting?
Keep it between us girls?
I was expecting you. Come in.
Yeah.
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
What did they say?
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
I can do that.
What the hell you talkin' bout?
How do you know she did that?
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
I thought you were sixteen.
I don't like dancing.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
Does that bother you?
Are you sweating?
Yeah, down the end.
This one.
As low as two.
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
The moon -- I dunno
An employee I had to let go.
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
So you're sure she's dead.
How much it there?
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
Gonna have to put up cash.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
Brown, Jackie Brown.
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.
All I did was walk out with it.
My office.
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
Turn left.
Yeah.
Hello, Sam.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Well, try, huh.
Now what?
Don't go.
Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
Used you?
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
How long had that been going on?
No. Not really ...
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
I saw Sarah the other day.
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
Who?
Not much. She's like you that way. Two clams. No wonder your marriage didn't last. Put your hand under your head. Take a breath and then let it out.
Louis, you're a life saver.
You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.
Jake, you need to rest.
Ah!
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
I don't know what to say.
But I see them.
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
It's not healthy with it closed.
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
The room!
They're weird names.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
I must have been out of my head.
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
What do you mean you can see?
I don't like things that make you cry.
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
I can waitress. I'm good.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
Sit down!
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
One drop?
It's strong stuff.
Pleasant dreams.
I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
I no from around here.
What is wrong with you?
We're doing everything we can.
I'm awake?
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
You can't talk in Brownsville?
Yeah.
Who is?
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
Why not?
The army?
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
Died?
Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy.
Yes it does.
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
We don't have a choice!
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Get out of here!
Kkinsa! Open the doors!
Let's move out!
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two -
My job.
Not a chance.
Where is he?
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
I know you.
Again?! Jesus!
Well, do something!
He was chasing me!
Close the fucking door!
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
I'm afraid I cannot assist.
Sory...
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
No! He's coming with us!
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
30? How long was I out?
That's right, now if you could...
Are you finished?
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
Three...two...one...
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
I want him out of the ocean.
He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
Where...?
Probably out in the back yard.
I never hear the whistle.
No. Home here.
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
I didn't agree to that!
I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
What d'ya mean?
Let's all have a drink.
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
You could say that.
He ate a car?
I can't stand here doing nothing!
C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say.
Anti-Shark cage.
It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. 
Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
And I'll drink to yours.
The shaft is giving.
I don't think so.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
You know how I feel about her.
I don't know...
So that's cool with you, then?
Whose idea was it?
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
It does?
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
No... I guess not.
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
I'm a junior.
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Shut up.
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
Yeah?
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
Go learn something.
You're gonna like this, I promise.
You do?
I don't know.
What's the matter?
Nothing...
Nothing.
What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?
Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
Either I just pissed my pants or...
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
Unfortunately, yes.
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
Eww, he's all beardy!
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
Don't mock me.
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
I suppose anything's possible.
There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
...Thank you.
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
Took 'em all.
Carryin' a gun.
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
This guy killed a mess of people.
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
Thank god!
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
Why, what did he do?
What are you going to do?
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
She wasn't feeling so good.
...Brian hurt his foot.
...You're hurting me...
...Janitor's job.
Could be.
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
17.
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
Did what take?
How long did you fuck her?
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
Right.
Yeah.
And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.
You think?
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
It is right.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
Right.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
Yeah me too nigga.
Who?
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
Yeah. Why you give money.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
What?
Right now?
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
I don't want you to hurt me.
Of course I do.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
No...
What?
Yeah, I guess so.
No.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Hell yeah, they don't know.
Mine are like my neck and my chest.
Who, Benny's little sister?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
No.
Holy shit. That's all true?
What?!
I don't know, eight or nine.
It's grandmother style.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
Let's see how much he wants to play.
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
Homesearchers.
You alright?
Maybe you're reaching a bit?  I think Sanderson should be in on this. There's a reason why the killer's calling him.
I haven't got time for this.
Why not?
"Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town.  Upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown.  Crawling through the window.  At the end of Miss Emma's street.  Her God has gone and left his home.  So her and I can meet."
Because she's the type.
Then call them!
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
--you're hopeless!  You can't even read a sentence!  Didn't they teach you punctuation in school?  The game ends tonight!
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
By that time the game will be over.
Please... wait.
Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
The pipes.
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
Of course not.
1985.  Hans Korshaud.
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
You're losing me.
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
Okay.
No prints.
Anything else?
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
Okay.  Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later.
To my room and then I went for a walk.
I got it from the tournament directory.
That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
This is insane!  Can't you see what's going on.  The killer wants me out of the way.  He's setting me up.
You're always in the middle of a match.
No.
Feel like practicing?
I can check and call you back.
What are they, please?
Yes.
No.  I don't.
Sounds very violent.
Are we talking about me, or chess?
We need your help.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
How can you look at it so clinically?
Of course.
Why?
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
Alright.  What about me?
No.
For emphasis?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
Right.  Here!  c-4.
Yeah.  I'll be there later.
Me too.
We're almost married.
Colwyn.
Where is the Fortress?
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command!  You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.
There is no other way.
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
The Beast will kill her.
I forbid you!
I road them often in my youth.
Yes. It is today.
Let me comfort you.
For that rudeness, peasant lout, I am going to leave you hanging by your heels when I depart. Which is right now.
I was hoping I might be your friend.
My <u>friend</u>.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
To the place where Death lives.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
A <u>boar</u>? Those incompetent louts couldn't catch a piglet, much less a boar.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
I cannot go with you, my friend.
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
You had better manners as a pig.
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little.  Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin.  Let me climb to the top and sing to it.
The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
That I am, my lady.
Yes. We lost five.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
I was beautiful then.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
You had a son.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
Why do you want to know?
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
No.
...Not at all.
OK.
What?
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
...Don't you like me?
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  You met anyway?
Yes.
...Yes.
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
I have no fear.
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
Here comes the resume.
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
What?
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
You do?
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
It'll make it.
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
Red flag, man.
That's all right isn't it?
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
Mammoth.
God damn, you're right... You don't say much Michelle, but what you say is golden.
Maybe.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
Yes.
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give you your fish sticks.
Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.
It's yours.
What do you think I should get?
No.
Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
No, this is fine. I was just wondering.
I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
It's not about sex, Ben. I'll make you up a bed on the sofa. Do it for me. We can talk till late and then sleep till late. As you know, I am my own boss.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
I don't understand any of that.
Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.
What did they look like?
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
I want this, Sera. I need this!
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
That's right.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.
I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
Are we done for today?
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Where you got in the shower.
Huh?
I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
No, she was crying her eyes out.
Spill.
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
Cried a lot and gained twenty pounds. Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I got jackcrap.
She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
Relation?
I'm her sister.
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
He's already got his coffee -- maybe he needs a donut.
What?
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
Josh proposed!
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
So Friday at eight?
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
What?
Uh, no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck.
Your what?
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
What, like it's that hard?
Uh -- sure.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
I gave her my word, Warner.
Yes.
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
You're right. Phew!
Fire moat... why do that?
We go out, smash 'em now?
Your love.
You should glory in your animal nature.  It is your triumph!  None know that better than I!
I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
Why have you brought me here?
At the moment, very little.  Your company at my table...
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
East of Mercia?
Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
There's a coil of golden thread fine as spider web yet naught can break it... and a silver key no lock can resist.
Gump, is it?
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
Don't you care about what's happened?
What do I do?
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
It would appear so.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
What know you of fields of war?
That would be Devil's Needle.  Last landmark I know in these woods.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Something the matter?
Ogg's footprints!
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
What magic have we on our side?
There must be some way to get it up there.
Fire away!
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
Patience, lad.
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
He'll not escape me.
You're on your own... like a true champion.
I've not heard a note out of you.
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
Very thrifty.  Even got your arrow back.
Never.
Or perchance...
Unicorn?
A promise is a sacred oath.
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
Who?
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
What?
That's why he goes masked during the day...
I can't see a thing.
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
His feet shall never cross my lips.
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
Ask away, sweet man.
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
No need for bells, Jack.  I'll nay enchant ye.
And charmed, of course.
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
We wait.
Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
You follow.
Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
And why was the alarm on?
Oh God, we don't want the police!
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
You look better without make-up.
Why?
I'm okay.
Why are you so stupid?
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
Are you afraid of heights?
You'd hate him for the trick.
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
Floating to Catalina.
He's at work while I'm here.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
A sink?
I flushed it down the toilet.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile.
Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
You're here early today.
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
I'll ask.
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
I'll get your bag.
Mom...please.
I'll hate you forever.
You're so predictable.
Sit down for a second.
I know.  Why?
What I'm not.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
Sun glasses?
To hide a black eye.
I'd build a house.
You know what mortise and tenon is?
I haven't been touched in years.
At least your father tried, George.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
Because he put the lock on!  Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?  I don't know anything, anymore!
Four days.  I left to think.
Kurt's been feeding him.
Why would they tow your truck?
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
One of you would end up dead.
I want him with me.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
Do you remember?
I dreamed about your house last night.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
You're not well.
No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
What did I say?
You've never said that before.
You bit my finger.
No.
Does Alyssa know?
I'm sixteen years old.  I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
A man he respects.
Should I?
Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
I never asked for more.
It's not ours.  It's George's.
Okay.
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
Why?
Dad said it first.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
At least the kid's getting out. Isn't this what you wanted?
Then what's the problem?
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
Why not?
Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
That's right! Good old Monroe...
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
Uh-huh.
Like this?
There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
Guess we better get going, huh?
Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body before!
So?
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
That's the way it is.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
That was five years ago.
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
'Course I was right. About what?
Yeah? You and what army?
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
You killed Santa Claus?
Life, huh? They step outta line again, we'll shorten up that sentence real fast.
Oh, right. Well, why didn't they get those pardons?
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
Don't you lie to me, Rayford.  You still have your daddy's watch?  Well, this is all I can give you. I wish it was more.
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
They gave me life, mama.
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
You found him.
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
I just want somebody who won't put a bullet in my back once the truck is full.
He's sick?
Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Is this a joke?
It's our time, brother.
Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
Urr... uggg... errr...
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
Maybe try the opposite of that.
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
Angels don't get any older, son.
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
I can't screw.  I can't screw.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
How bad?
I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
That's a pretty brassiere.
Beast.
Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
See ya, fellas.
You keep a bat under your seat?
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
You have a dog? What kind?
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
My perfume?
Good. I was concerned.
Basically, yeah.
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
I love you.
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
Only a few? You're just not trying.
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
Did you?
I'm fine...  See you...
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
When do you go up?
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
And now?
I'm afraid to tell you.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
It's different now. Help me.
I don't..
That's tomorrow.
That's nice.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
No. Not that either.
He's good, isn't he?
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
I won't.
You know, Jessica.
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
Mother and Father said so... you know?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
All right.
Can you make it back?
Yes, I thought my wife...
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.
Right... This just glided along.
I used to.
Pornos.
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
Okay.
Why are ya goin' so early?
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
Yes.
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
What happened to me?
No.
Yes.
No.
Out in back.
Did you ask him who he is?
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
I can't give you anymore. I'll talk to the doctor.
What are you going to do?
I wish I knew.
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
Was there?
It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go.
What'd I tell ya.
No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the "Caddy" by tomorrow.
What?
You know who it is.
At your house. Don't you remember?
Whatiya mean?
I don't know.
Go home, Sheila.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
Is it?
Yes.
Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
All right, all right. Keep quiet.
Do you think they're cannibals?
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
Think of it! In times like these.
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
108 and still active?
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
Very often.
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
Yes.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
Oh, dear.
Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
Father Perrault is dead.
Hey!
What is it, my son?
Right, Bob.
Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
Yes.
It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
Porters?
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
Yes, the little Russian girl.
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
Why, you - you— Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
I saw a man whose life was empty.
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
Perhaps.
It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
And Goodwill Toward Man?
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.
We're the government, Cowan.
Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.
Kay, I'm sorry...
Actually that's a very good question.  The answer-- if You'll Just look at this Part-- is here.
This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
You don't know me at all.
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
How does that help me?
Do his job.
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
Yeah ... ?
I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
You're not taking me in!
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
Nope.  Nothing at all.
They haven't announced it yet.  All I know is we're in motion for the most watched media event in history.
Don't tell me.  Insects.
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
They're inside.
Agatha...
He'll turn around.
RUN!
Then who was he?
Found?  Where?
I know... I do, too...
Whatever you say, John.
Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
For that, we have to go for a ride.
It's actually kind of a rush.  They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes.  That all your dreams come true.
Uh-huh...
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
I'm fine, Lamar.
Can you fake the cerebral output?
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
Everybody runs.
Run the subscription list...
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
We're in motion on something.
Take your time.
Yes, it is.
But you call this room the "temple".
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
That's right.
Tell me how.
What a big boy.  How old are you?
Good-bye, Dad...
If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
Who made you do this?
The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
And how would I know that?
You don't seem all that proud.
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
He's dead, Lara.
I was, but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here.  This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
Not.  Now.
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
This murder is happening at two different times.
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Right here.
Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
I don't know, why?
How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
Sure.  Raincheck.
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
I haven't seen him in two years.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
We have snifters
Phone, room service, mini-bar. Any additional expense. If you need anything you can push the button marked 'Concierge', and they'll be able to help you.
Yes, sir.
Are you sure?
No.
He's great, right. Is he great?
He's alright.
Bullshit.
No.
He's not doing it.
No. What kind of bachelor party?
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
With what?
But what about them?
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
Excuse --
So, when's the drop.
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
Quick drop. In and out.
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
Pshhh...
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
What?
Yeah.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
He'll work it off.
What is it?
Good morning.
Bobby.
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
Soho.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
No. Just the cross streets.
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
I'll page you with the number.
He didn't say we need guns.
I like it.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
You sure?
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
This is bullshit, man.
What the fuck do you...
Yeah. What vibe?
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
What's up?
We're getting whacked.
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
Wanna bet?
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
No more, man.
Let's just go now and wait.
Three and a half hours?
No. I'll wait here.
Bobby and Ricky.
The line's over there.
S'up.
You look good, man.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Ugh...
Drinks are free, right?
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
'Strapped?'
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
He has a cute what...?
Man's rep travels.
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
When?
Solid, daddy.
I'll take your goddam bet.
You owe me six big ones.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
Elijah who?
What do you do with your time?
Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
How do you like it?
Just an idle question.
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
You have to sleep for three.
Betty it's me. It's me.
Let some of us come down there.
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
What color were the original Hebrews?
Then we don't know that God was white.
Let me do it then.
Say what you're saying.
Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
Murder.
Did you hear me?!
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Shorty, this is Laura.
You're too small to be Bogart.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
Might be all right.
Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge?
Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
Watch your tongue, boy.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.
[I have a friend there.]
Deal.
[Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]
[Don't lie to me.]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[Ordered by who?]
[I don't know. No one knows.]
[I believe you.]
[The one who transferred Pinta to their car.]
[How do I recognize him.]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[Don't lie to me!]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Nothing wrong.
I came to visit you.
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
Two days gone. They're negotiating a ransom.
I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.
I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
That's right.
I'm not crying.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
Well, I let him go.
They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
Yes.
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
The gunshot holds no fear.
Why today? And why'd she have to go with him?
You don't drink like you used to.
That's not a question.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Still not a question.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
You think too much?
Never.
No.
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
Last night. Do you know something?
[No. Why?]
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
Our daughter.
[That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.]
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
Which one was that?
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute.
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
Oh.
When was this?
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
What they say?
Who?
I'm thirty-four.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
Well, that's what I was saying. My father is getting old. And we're very close. He's a wonderful man, really...
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
Nothing.
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
How do you do?
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
I'm just here with another girl.
Oh, that's a sad story.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
About eight o'clock.
Sure, great if you ain't married.
Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
What nurses?
This is a good deal here, Marty.
I thought he was a big tall fat fellow. Didn't I meet him here one time? Big tall, fat fellow, he tried to sell me life insurance?
I just this minute got the baby to sleep.
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
Well...
I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
That's all right, that's all right...
On accounta...
Sure, sure.
Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski – Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.
Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
No.  Or why you should.
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
And gets the wind every time it opens. No, thanks. I'll take that one.
Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
I don't mind. If we give them something to talk about.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.
Neither does Henry Blake. But I'll tell you what makes him the best C.O. you've got in any of your hospitals. He leaves all the medical decisions to the men who do the day- to-day work and understand what meatball surgery is.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.
I don't get it.
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
I think we could still have a chance.
It's possible
It isn't always this rough?
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
Very happily married.
Same here.
But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye.  You helped me pull together when I needed it.
A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Proud to know you, Trapper. Like to shake your hand if you'll hurry up and get that chest closed.  You still working the trains?
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Sir?
Yes, Colonel.
That bad?  But I guess you're right. We might as well see him.  Got any caddie carts?
Now?
Boys, we're home free.
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
No.
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Yes, sir.
Thirty dollars.
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house—and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and—
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor—
If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
What John Doe?
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius— Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe—and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
Sure!  When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
What bonus?
Packs everything, including a gun.  Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut.
I wish he had a family, though.
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Take it easy, John Doe.
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
Where's Connell?
Who?
Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney—
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Hiyah, John.  John, I want to have a little talk with you.  What's the matter—are you falling? Come here.
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
Did you write it—or didn't you?
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Good night, John.
Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.
Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you make—and it's all written out for you.
Dinner's on you.
Deal.
May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
What happened, Mike.
Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Roper...
Shut the fuck up and do what I say!
It was okay.
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
So what do I say to this guy?
What's the first commandment?
Still needs work.
Yeah, first and second.
And doing a very good job of it.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
And what about the ones you don't save?
Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
Only that floor.
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
...Let me just show you.
...the hell are you talking about?
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
Because I took it out of your memory.
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
Then what?
And down here --
It's his nature.
But what if he doesn't --
Take care?  Where the hell are you going --
The truth.
Not his style.
Insurance?
Some things never change, do they?
-- Katie.
Corporation can.
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
This.  No point to it.
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
Uplink selected.
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
They're called squirbs.
It will not harm you.
Now tell me... what do you see?
OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!
In another time, another dimension.  It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies.  For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished.
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
THERE'S THE COMET!
A stellar idea, Skull.
By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
Wait for me!
Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR!  KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY.  ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD
NINJA FALCON ZORD!
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
Poor, yeah.
I guess I am. Just a little.
I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
But if ya can't catch the guys...
You got men on Profaci's place?
We got our boys paintin' the house next door. Around the clock. We're gonna keep old man Profaci alive if it takes twenty coats.
How's Bugsy doin'?
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
I can just imagine.
You're sure?
It's a mask.
Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
Italians, Jews, Irish. One big party. Course, some guys don't get along.
Tommy Reina.
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Boss, I got all the time you need.
Didn't know you felt that way.
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
Not if they all die at once.
Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
I don't fuck my partners.
No worry, Charlie. I will kill them for you. No one will know.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
Jesus.
Open a window. Every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
Anything!
Anything ain't a very hard number.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
I don't know. I guess it was...
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with?
I didn't say anything.
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
And last...you remember Bill here, from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like.
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
Uh huh. And?
Tell me what?
Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
Maybe you could talk to Death!
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
Got a doctor on duty.
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
<i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
Oh, I hope so, dear.
... Manly?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
What for? Why, suppose there's a storm--all lines are down--how you gonna get a message to Ma?
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
You got worms.
Sure--sure--wait a minute now--simmer down--
Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Again? Good idea.
Tonight?
Okay. You don't mind?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Tunnel?
Do we *have* to?
Where?
My first name's--Clarissa.
Take me home, Diz.
Diz--get what he says to the people back in that State. It's up to you and the boys. Keep those wires hot. Fire away, pal!
Taylor, my dear.
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
No wonder--without your dinner.
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
*Your* political future! I bought it for you and made you a present. And I can grab it back so fast it'll make your head spin. You got a nerve to stand there and worry about just *your future* when we're in this spot!  The man is--*Miller*.
Just get one hand against each ear there--keep his face straight up.
Oh, a *boy*!
Emma! Will you *please*--?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
Goodnight, Miss Paine.
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
Satan's in this little fella tonight!
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
Mine? Why--naturally--whatever benefits the state is mighty important to me--owning a lot of its industry-- newspapers and other odds and ends. And if I thought you had the welfare of the state at heart, like myself-- for instance, if you were to turn around and help a project like this along instead of standing in the way-- why, I'd say you were a man to watch. For a fellow your age, you'd be in a spot to make a great start in life. If you liked business--you could pick any job in the state and go right to the top. Or politics. If you like being a Senator. No reason why you couldn't come back to that Senate for the rest of your life.
The man downstairs said number--
No!
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
What?
He did?
It hasn't been easy, has it?
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
Terrible, thank you.
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
You win. It's--Clarissa.
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
Yes. The most beautiful I think I ever--gee--  Say--we're *never* going to finish this thing! Now, here we go, Saunders. I'm going to talk faster'n you can write--
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
Not another bill?
Do you want to dictate them?
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
But--I've done everything I--
That's what I said--the *truth*!
If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
That is merely your *impression*, Senator. The Chair has yet to settle the question to its own satisfaction!
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
Let's get away from here. 
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
--now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
Saunders--it's meat and drink--lemme at 'im! Five minutes--! I'll make it right with you!
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
You're the best nurse I can think of--
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
Yeah?  And what else?
I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
Well--me, too!
Don't worry about Horace--he'll take orders. Come on--
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
Are these the articles?
Yes!
It isn't all! I'd like to explain—
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
Yeah, let's.
It's wonderful.
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
Really?
He did? I play the tuba—
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
I don't blame you.
Nothing.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That—"
Hurry up!
Close that door.  Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please?
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Yes, sir.
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Me sir?
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
Proceed.
Mr. Cedar!
But your honor—
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney—
Hang up.
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
How do you do.
Yes.
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine.  If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir.
He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.
Why should you?
No, thanks.
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Naturally.
What kind of wife did you say she was?
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
I write poetry.
Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York. We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.
Yeah. What?
Thank you so much. Good night.
Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
Yes, sir.
Prairie? Oysters?
Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
What two policemen?
Looking for?
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
Me more than most.
How did they threaten you?
Hmm?
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
I think he's got a point.
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
Are we?
As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
What exactly is it supposed to do?
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
Doc. Nice to meet you.
Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
We've been talking about her, mostly.
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.
What?
Well, come on in.
Who was that?
You like me. How come?
Where am I supposed to eat?
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
Sure I can, Lionel.
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Sure.
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
Do you think that's a good idea?
That's right, the fake kind.
Why don't you tell me?
Just who is here, can you tell me?
No.
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
Be specific.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
And this is legitimate therapy?
Which thing?
I don't know if --
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
Which show was that?
You probably got the idea.
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
What are you talking about?
How are you?
Far out. Single malt?  Can I pick it?
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
Definitely.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
Did you carry a gun?
How'd you do it?  The new you.
English Lit.
I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.
You're completely reliable.
Really?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Yep.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
In the desert? What for?
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
What is he doing here?
You will not believe it.
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
What did you find? What did you see?
I found sand. I saw death.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
If you call that a kiss.
Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?
No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
Way to go, Evy.
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
If he decides to wake up, hell yes!
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
I knew you'd know.
One last tweak.
Get on to yourself!
You're nuts.
Against.
So are you!
Sure -- I guess.
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Not tonight. 
He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
When are you going to take off that mask?
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
Why not?
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
Well they've crawled back out.
He hasn't stolen it yet.
Ow.
Or both.
He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.
The bazookas?
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
I think it's absolutely charming.
I'm glad you like it.
About 5,000 troops.
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
And who is defending Paris?
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Ajaccio.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
Impossible, I don't believe it.
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
No...
And you, Junot?
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
When is she supposed to return?
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
Ah, well, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness.
I thought I was.  I was confused.
No.
I will never forgive you.
Promise.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
Yes!!
Five minutes.
Yes, I'm sure he's been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife.
All right, thank you.  Please ask him to come here.
You wrote it.
You couldn't face telling me what?
Yes.
Oh, then you are...
Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
Naw, it ain't like that.
Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
Don't move me.
You know what he mean, dude.
Cheeco.
Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
What?
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
Damn, you got a stalker.
If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home.  I gotta live here.  Just remember that.
Me too.
No, man, just wait.
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
I don't play for no team.
Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course.
Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta hit the high-way!
I do.
Have you seen Day-Day?
Nice to meet you?
I don't have no damn cover.
You could sell your Beamer.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
I don't know.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
Okay.  Bye, Craig.
It's an important speech.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
Yes?
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
I have a problem.
And your husband works for somebody else.
What the hell are you saying?
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
Indeed.
Me?
How should I...?
No, please...
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
No, kisses to...
Keep it.
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
Please...
Don't think I won't.
I don't know.
What are you going to do now?
Could I see it?
You're a big girl, huh?
It better be.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Where?
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
Ain't nobody goin' to neither, long as Uncle Birdie's around.
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
John: you go fetch Ruby.  Big Ruby's my problem girl. She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but Ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Sshhh! He's in there.
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
There's something else.
She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
What!
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
The Blue Men?
John! Don't!
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
To see Dad?
Ssh...
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
No. No.
Come on, children!
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
What secret shall I tell?
How old are you?
That's no secret. I'm five.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
I think it's time we got one thing perfectly clear, Willa. Marriage to me represents a blending of two spirits in the sight of Heaven.
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
How'do.
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
My flesh and blood!
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
I been out with men.
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
What?
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
You know he's dead though, right?
Sure, but...
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
Krueger.
Warm milk. Gross.
Great
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Nancy?
I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
He's nuts about you.
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
Bring me forty-five back.
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
An evening gown.
A dress you wear in the evening.
What do you wear in the morning?
You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
Possibly.
Or we can't go back to Russia!
That's another thing... it's spring.
We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
And they might believe her in Moscow.
Just see how happy the people look... from here....
Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
Eight forty-two, sir.
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
He wouldn't say that. What he would say is "Buljanoff, you can't afford to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you? Do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all? Phooey, Buljanoff!"
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
I'll send you a muff.
Just looking around.
Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!
No, thank you.
You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
Yes. It is unfortunate.
In other words you don't know.
And where are we?
Your type will soon be extinct.
Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
Yes.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Then do it through my lawyer!
So! You want to make a strike breaker out of me! I am surprised at you, Comrade! Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? All I can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite!
What are you after?
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Then you should go back to your table.
No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not yet. Not until I've made you laugh... at least once.
I don't think so.
You see? Life can be so simple.
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
And General Savitzky.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
I know... it's the Russian soul.
But I can throw it out of the window.
They belong to the people.
It is their wish.
Yes, sweetheart. 
So happy and so tired.
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
Good morning, Swana.
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
Those newspaper people?
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
That bad?  Old or young?
Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
No thanks, Swana.
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
Hello.
Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious.
Unfortunately.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
That depends on the tip.
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
May I ask why?
Thank you.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
"Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?
Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
You do it.
You think this is just about politics?
Jesus!  Through a window?
And?
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
This is not a joke, John!
We should set up a Cuban defense fund on this; take care of all of them.
-- as long as he's got secret files on everybody.  I don't want 'em used against us.  What about the CIA?  Helms's done nothing for us.  I want to see him.
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
... go on.
There's no secrets here, Al.
You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now, sir, but ... but you need to get out more, sir, and talk to the people.  No one I know feels ... close to you.
So?
Sir, the deadline is today.
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
I know it well, sir.
I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
What do you mean, sir?
"National Priority."
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
... an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to become involved in Latin America.  We would lose all our friends in Latin America.
Jesus!
Sir?
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard.  Strength in this life.  Happiness in the next.
Go to law school.  Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it now ...
You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers.  Things I signed as Vice President.  I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
I don't think we can treat this as a formality.  Mr. Kennedy made a verbal promise to the Russians not to invade Cuba.  But you authorized Dr. Kissinger to put this in writing.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
Winning?
I never met the man.
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
It won't.  As long as I'm here.
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
Nobody's gonna beat Kennedy in '64 with all the money in the world.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
What I think is ... they're cowards. Their opposition represents the cowardice of the Eastern Establishment.  They don't realize as you do, Mr. President, that the Communists only respect strength, and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the "madman," Richard Nixon.
Yes.
What the hell -- I love her.  And she's great in bed.
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
Jesus Christ!
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
That was a long time ago.
Then what's the point?  What's the point of being president?  You're powerless.
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
You're not a failure, Dick.
You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
I'll concede in the morning.
No, I'm not!  I'm finished.
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
What matters to me is whether you understand it.
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
Lost.
What?
Whatcha mean by that?
Some say you are, Rocky.
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
You heard it?
All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
Yessir. It may be that. In a nutshell.
Uh-huh.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
He can take all comers.
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
No. Probably I don't.
That from the lock?
Yes sir.
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
Natural to the line of work they was in.
Okay.
What do you think.
I mean, would you care to join me.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
...I need to sit down.
Yes. Things fall into place.
It's full a money.
Yeah.
What're you doin', baby?
Uh-huh.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
Llewelyn?
I know where it's going to be.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
So what're you goin' up there for.
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
I see.
What way would that be?
I was just passin' the time.
You already asked me that.
Well... I need to see about closin'.
You married into it.
Sir?
Nineteen fifty-eight. It's been traveling twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails, and you have to say. Call it.
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
Let's just call it square.
The what?
I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
Cast iron?
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
To kill your wife.
No I don't have it.
No. You don't.
What outfit.
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
It wasn't a woman.
I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
Tell him what you told me.
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
"Thirty-two?"
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
You're late, Eric.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
You told me that two hours ago.
I know. It's up to us.
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
I ran back in to get the phone.
I got you, Del...
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
Roy! What are you doing here?
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
No. Loma Vista.
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
Man, that is love.
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
The Five?
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
You said in L.A., anything goes.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
Rosa...
I have to leave now.
Deranged. That would be the right word.
Huh?
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
Fine. You got five...
Of what?
No...
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
IT SURE IS!!
What 'look'?
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
I'm not telling.
What?
Well... I think I saw her soul.
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
It just didn't fit her profile...
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
We know that...
...yeah.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
I swear to God!
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
You can't do this -
You can't do this - we just been pardoned!  By the Governer himself!
Gopher, Everett?
All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!
Do not seek the treasure!
Gopher, Everett?
And no transmission belt for two weeks neither.
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
Oh my God!
Everett, my beard itches.
Okay, Pappy.
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Helluva awgazation.
...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
That's not my ring.
Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
We got but four days to get to that treasure! After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake!
That don't make no sense!
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
Oh mercy, yes. You gotta beat that competition.
Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
He's a suitor!
Buyin' nipples!
Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.
Stop calling me 'sir! I ain't no officer. My name is Byron.
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I would've come.
I joined the Navy.
Hey, Zackie -- don't go away mad.
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
Come over here where I can see you.
Yes, Joe.
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
I called you Sarge.
No, sir!
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
He was. He died.
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
How late?
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
But in what ways?
You hope.
He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
I haven't made up my mind.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Not me.
Me, too.
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
I know who you are and what you want.
That's it?
No. Is that what you want?
Because he's my friend, too.
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
No problem, but who's Susan?
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
Doesn't mean shit. Get her to a doctor. You can't do anything until you hear what he says. Make the appointment yourself.
But she expects you to marry her?
Peace out.
She didn't.
You know how this gotta end.
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
They're gonna die in there!
Hey.
What about us?
Yeah, whatever.
I mean it!
The sentence that started "There are three."  What was the rest?
No ball, kid.
Open it.
I said open the door.
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
Shaky?
Nope.
Chills?
Get the fuck out of my house!
Don't though. 
I don't know, why?
Come on, come on...
Shhh...
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
Oh shit Alma... you're...
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
What's with you?
Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
Man, fuck you!!!
Look this is bull...
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
They couldn't have thought this up for themselves.
As far as Mr. Hoover is concerned the worst has happened, the Panthers have unified with other organizations -- most likely sponsored by communists -- to undermine the war in Vietnam.  By doing so, they have quite simply guaranteed their own extinction.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
No sir he didn't.
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
No you wait a second. You and your "Panthers" got three choices. One you join with us and follow our rules. Two you change your name.  Or three you face annihilation.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
Brimmer.
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll...
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
Mom! It wasn't like that. It was bullsh... They were just harassing us. No charges were filed. It's alright.
I don't know. I really don't.
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
His journals, letters, maps, books...
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
As you wish.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
Are you going to meet with him?
Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
It's already over.
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
I know.
Seven homes along the Black River so far...
As you did at Fort Wilderness?
Name five hundred.
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
Where is he now?
Robert.  Robert E. Lee.
But what about Thomas?
Worse.
But father, they might come this way.
Bite?
Ayuh.
Well...I guess not.
Yes--
Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Well, I thought it was safe--
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
Then why do I have to go to bed?
Good for you.
Sure.
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
Yes, but--
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Well...a touch of the flu...
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
Leave me alone!
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
Louis, are you sure?
That boat is my livelihood!
She.  Goes.  Free.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
Track you down and --
Now.  No, don't kill him.
No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
Then why aren't you eating?
At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
You're right.  Here's luck to you, Will Turner.
Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
I said, no lies.
Only a little.
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
Agreed!
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
... no.
Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!
Bleak.  Very bleak.
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
That remains to be seen.
If you loved me like I loved you?
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Poppy, order the trucks from the Gary plant.  And we're going to need a containment crew.
Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
I want Trix!  Mommy!
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
Opportunity?
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Who isn't?
Okay.
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
Been out for six months now.
Same old Daniel.
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
Yeah, we'll see.
No, something is really wrong... look!
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
I'm a plastic man!  A plastic man!
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
You're the doctor.
What?  What's wrong?
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
I'm glad you came to me for help.
Probably the caffeine.
I don't know.
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
Like a glove.
On the counter.
Let's go.
You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
God, what a fight that was.
Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
Goodbye, Stew—
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
You don't wear garters!
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Gallagher!
Yes - isn't it?
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize.
Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you?
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves—
Sit down!
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
Look! Look! The front page!
Huh?
As one Tribune man to another—
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
Yeah?
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
No!
'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see—'  Tweet, tweet - ha, ha—
You're my what?
Your valet, sir.
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
Yes sir!
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
I didn't run away.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
There you are—!
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
Never even been to New Madrid.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Right.
Right.
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
There's nothing sudden about that—  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and—
I suppose you know why I came—?
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
Surely, come right in.
Thanks. May I sit down?
It's all right. Bring him in.
Hello, Joe.
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Yes sir.
It can't be possible.
I'm sorry ...
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
No I'm not sweetie.
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
I said, NO!  ... I've read like one book in my whole life and I'll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire ...
... How?
Still doesn't make it right.
Very well ...
Why am I out of order?
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
Well, I never had to do it before.
Pleasantville Marathon?
What's going to happen?
We're supposed to be in school.
We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God ...
I don't think so.
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
He won't notice anyway.
I just don't think we have the right to ...
It's fine.
That's great.
How come I'm still in black and white?
What?
Honestly ... no.
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
No. I baked them for you.
No. I baked them for you.
What's that like?
I like it too.
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
What department store did they go to?
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
I had nothing to do with that.
Look ...
Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
Oh.
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
I'm so glad you're here.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Hey.
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
Yes, I'll be there.
This is "Fly With Us?"
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
So you're coming tonight, right?
...please, I just don't want it....
No.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
No she didn't; that's a lie.
I....please don't do this.
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Sure.
You sound very cute, very nice.
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
Yes.
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
....what....?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
You lied to me?
Do you know them.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
Ok.
....yeah....
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Yes.
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
Yeah.
Yeah......yeah.....
IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.
Yeah.
I'm fine are you ok?
You can't do that.
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
Ok, bye, bye.
I cut myself.
I know.
......and this is confidential?
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What's your problem?
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
....I have seven.
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
Yes I'm fine.
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
What's with all this pudding, what is this?
Yes.
What is this, man?
Yes. Sorry.
This is a bunch of bullshit.
Nothing.
I'll see you there.
As soon as you want.
What's the problem?
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
Are you sure?
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
Sorry.
It's fine.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Ok.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
By whom? The Marquis?
They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn.
You'll hate me now, won't you?
It's not even noon --
Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
An innocent child is dead.
So many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work. I am blessed, am I not?
I know, because I felt it myself --
And his writing?
Do you favor its publication?
For sale? To the general public? Certainly not; it's unprintable.
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
And my own.
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
Enough!
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delbenè; I look to the future.
Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
Don't start --
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
Fiendishly so.
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
It's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, AREN'T YOU?
I'd rather read, thank-you.
Houdini mice.
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
My name is Orson Welles
And director.
So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind of sad future are we two making? A future where men will do anything to sell their newspapers and their movies? A future where no price is too high for fame and power? When we will all scratch each other to pieces just to be heard?
Don't
Pops
How much?
Yes.
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
I will not defend my life to you--
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
Sir? 
Sir, I-
Please be quiet.
"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--"  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
Can I talk to Hearst?
Nonsense
Telling stories.
The great Spanish bullfighter
Oh Christ
Listen to me-
How?
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
Kinda.
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
We already made the same offer to the stockholders.
Jesus
They've all seen a rough cut
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
All right, you guys, shake hands.
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
Do you think I'd let her in a place like this with guys like you hangin' around?
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Hit me in the face.
You want me to do what?
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Whadda you care?
Go 'head.
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
How many times do I have to hit her? I hit her enough.
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
You want the title shot or not?
C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you.
G'wan, do it.  Protect yourself, rummy.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
I did keep an eye...
Does that mean...
Nine o'clock.
Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
No.
But, Jake, I was just...
Nobody. I love you, remember?
You're hurting my arm.
I took the kids to my sister's.
What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.
I don't know.
I'm leaving you Jake.
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
Are you drunk?
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
Namely?
Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Ever get an answer?
All the things I hate.
Tom, I've got something real big for you.
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
For what?
For getting rid of that cast.
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
I don't want to.
No.
She's just not the girl for me.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
Intelligence! Nothing has caused the human race more trouble. Modern marriage!
And some man will lose his.
Isn't he a salesman?
Would four of them -- ?
There's probably one in the basement.
Yes.
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
Lisa! Shut up!
Of course not.
Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Something too frightful to utter.
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
All right -- but what's he doing now?
He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
Phone number?
Buzz Gundersen.
No.  We're going to bring him down.
Hang loose.  We got all night.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
I was in it.
Will you wait a minute?
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
Come back tomorrow.
Plato.  It's a nickname.
No.  It's perpetual motion.
No.  In the morning.
No.  It's okay.
It's me!
Judy.
What do you think?
Why?
Come on!
Mom--I'm not--
Grandma?
No.
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
See, I'm new.
You're really flipped--aren't you.
Yeah--why--
Dig the square wardrobe!
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
It doesn't matter to them.
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
It's all right.
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
That one?
What?
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
Daddy--
Hi.
Gabriel!
YES!!!
-- till he fucked his parole --
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
What.
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
Nick...
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
You're in on this.
Canada.
We? What "we"...
I love you, Nick...
We'll need one.
He says he wants it now.
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
No --
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
But I never said Rudy.
I never told you my name.
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
I shared his cell!
She says a lot of things.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
I don't know.
You know where the guards are. You know how to get in and out. You know where the money is.  We're taking down that casino, convict. You're the guy gonna tell us how.
Get out.
I'm gonna need some money.
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
No way.
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
I don't know... what you're...
I don't steal any --
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
Oh, man --
Three days, man.
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
Oh.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
Aw, Rudy.
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
Who the hell made this map.
What?
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
This better not be some Freddy joke.
But what is this?
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
It's a change.
Take a seat.
How is he?
Juicy, junior, real juicy.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
Nope.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
We think we got a rat in the house.
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
No, I'm not!
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
I can' take you to a hospital.
When I was coming down here, I was playin' it. And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million-trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.
Fuck all that.
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
Let's go in the other room...
I'm cool.
Where? Are they out in the car?
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
I think he's just passed out.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
I don't know anybody.
So you wanna git bit, huh?
Yeah, those guys too.
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
Look of things, she doesn't.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
It doesn't matter who they are.
No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
As far as -- Sonora?
I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
But you eat, don't you?
In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
Go on. Tell me more about her.
I'll make the soap myself.
But the rest is right.
Why do you think?
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
Like I said, women get in the way sometimes.
A fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden, he don't take chances. My name's Clayton and I'm looking for someone.
She's a friend -- took off this morning sort of sudden while I wasn't around.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
Finished, son?
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
What's there to be fair about?
I don't care.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
Go ahead.
Quit worryin' about Elaine.
Where is he?
Because there's a man I want to see.
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
What do they look like?
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
You were supposed to be reading words.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
I found a picture of his wife.
Wife?!
That's it.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
Maybe we can study together or something.
No. Keep rubbing.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
So, whatever happened to her?
Alright, let's take a vote...
Yes, we made it!
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.
Theo, did you see the animal?
Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.
I wouldn't go that far.
Let me see the files.
They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone.
That one.
Are you sure it's not the tape?
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
Hi.
Just a little experiment.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
A little bit... Give me your belt.
Alright, go to the belt store...
Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
Then let us prepare.
No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.
Dog, you look hot.
I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!
Is MOM... in there?
Always the dentist.
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Let me see!
No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies. 
CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word!
And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
I didn't do it!
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
Yes, I was.
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
You think my sister is there?
Listen ——
Yes.
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
As a man, you distrust me —- perhaps you believe me as a physician.
She can only use cash.
I'll try there.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
And that was all?
I saw him on the floor. He was cut -—  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him —— white —— and the men holding him up between them.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
Yes.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
It's grown big with time -- I've lived here with the Romari's for ten years -- the room's become part of me. I want you to see it —— to know me better.
It's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars --
But you're happy here -- you like your work —-
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
You know where she is?
I'd hardly describe It that way —- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
I'm afraid not.
Yes —— and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.
Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
She's very beautiful.
Why
Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
You mean like "time flies"?
Nine years.
Who's Elizabeth?
Lawyers.
No.
My therapist said that --
Basically, yes.
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
You just ask them questions?
Maybe you want to go.
It won't. Are you ready?
Ann Bishop Millaney.
When we're making love?
Absolutely not.
About me?
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
Yes.
That's correct.
So you have had sex.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
But if you were?
That's very flattering.
Yes.
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
I'm okay. It's okay.
I called you Tuesday at 3:30 and they said you weren't in. Do you remember where you were?
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
I ate by myself.
Are you having an affair?
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
I want out of this marriage.
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
Not very often.
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.
No, I haven't.
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
Yes.
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
He doesn't have a phone.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
I just thought it might --
Fine.
Because I never got around to it.
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
Cynthia!
What!?
Why?
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
You are in serious trouble.
Then why do you keep asking about it?
It looks like a tablecloth.
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
Doing what?
Whichever you prefer.
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
Were you disappointed?
Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
No.
Who said I was jealous?
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Not today. I've got other plans.
She's there? What's she doing there?
I don't think my sister would agree.
Right.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
I just... Ann is very...
No.
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
Student?
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
She's not property, John, she's a person. Were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
God, you need help.
I'm not going to give you my keys.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Medical clinic?
Uh, OK. Sure.
Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
That's the one.
Did I say anything?
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
Yeah? What do I do then?
YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME
Of course.
Time to check with Flavors.
You got it!
I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
Why Janet?
So it seems.
Well, Betty, there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly...
Yes, Betty.  But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
I don't want to get up there.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT
He was adopted you know.
Sure thing.
He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
I know.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
Foods!
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
We love you, Baby.
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
You guys having fun?
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Oh yeah.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
So you're going to stop acting?
We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
What?
Nah. I want to watch this.
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
Aye-aye, captain.
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
We were supposed to play golf.
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
What?
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
Been checking your messages?
Just trying to be helpful.  It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet.
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
No way. No way.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
The Windmill.
Oh yeah? How is it?
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
What was the bottle that did it?
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Yeah. Definitely.
Oh. You mean... today?
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
What about me?
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
I had class.
Well, nice to see you now.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
What rehearsal dinner?
Oh, Maya. No.
Yeah.
Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune!
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Exactement!
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
Right.
Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.
Explain noises.
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
How can you say that?
From what?
Yes.
Don't do it.
Sorry.
What about them?
What was the first thing?
I would say so.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
Why not?
Pinned? What does that mean?
Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them...  ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
Didn't Paden tell you that?
I already did that.
My name is Emmett.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
I haven't done anything.
Where's Turley?
Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
It's not going to be easy.
I'm going to California with my brother.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
We wait.
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
You're kidding.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
Daddy's dead.
Who did it?
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
Because I'm your sister.
You don't know?
Did you hear his son is still around?
It is that.
Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend.  But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt.
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
Paden.
And I know what I'm talking about.
Who's the owner?
Give me some of the good stuff.
He left me.
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
I don't want you to get hurt.
He can't hurt me if he's dead.
Who?
Difficult.  I'm difficult.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
-- It's called a projector.
I can't wait to meet her.
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
Why not?
There isn't one.
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time.
-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear.  I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...
Viktor, you should have said something.
Really?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
When is she coming over?
I just read somewhere --
Not if I don't let her.
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
Hello, is this Elaine?
Where are you?
Just a minute.
... so much like her?
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
Clyde.
You're so far off!  Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co- star.  Remember now?... No, I don't think he's put on weight.  Anyway, you think he's right for "Eternity Forever"?... not the right type?... a different direction...  I'll try to talk her into it.
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together.  Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago.  Let's move on.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
You know, I... don't know.
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
It's a yacht.
-- I bet you have.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
Taller, Viktor.
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started.
Yes.  Yes, it is.
Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the truth about you, why wouldn't I...?  Of course, with Hank's tragic passing, the secret died with him.  I am going to tell the truth... after your next picture.
I was hoping you'd say that.
No.
Yes.
No.
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
Never mind.
I don't know.
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
Oh.
Yes.
...I don't know.
Got it.
How'd he know I'd come?
Superstition.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
Fuck you.
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Not someone -- Mac.
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
Metaphysical question, man.
"And a slash-slash there --"
She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.
Who? Us?!
Down boy.
You got something against farm people, Keith?
Not at all. They lynched my ancestors, they smell like manure, they have sex with their relatives... and they all have two first names: "Bobby- Joe" --
Chicken sandwich?
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.
Nothing to tell.
About what?
It's you. You and your father.
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Oh, yeah?
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Hell, I was game!
Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
You.
Who'd want to?
Eyes on the road.
Driving, talking to me...
You just passed your nemesis.
Enjoy your Kenworth.
You could've asked.
Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
The minute you see him, you'll know.
But you'll do it?
Waynette!
Let's keep it that way.
Clear and rolling.
What does the old Timex say?
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
Son-of-a-gun. Me too.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
Let's boogie.
What's that, pardner?
My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
Yes, ma'am.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
Yeah, but the Untouchables took down Capone. Heller got shot and killed. The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza walked.
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
You woulda?
Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.
I know you left him a message. What did you say!
I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
That's the punchline, y'ready?
No shit.
Right, you got clicks, anything?
You love her?
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
It's just a little casino inspection, don't trip, he's alone.  Alright, let's set this spinnin'...
You're not Gibarian...
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
Listen --
What was it?
Why?
When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?
Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should we check?
Maybe you can.
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
Book?
Let's go home.
When I saw you were gone I got scared.
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
How old were you?
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
Sartorius.
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
Those are dreams.
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
I'm disgusting.
You should have told me.
I can't --
I don't know anymore.  All I see is you.
It's an experiment.
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
You didn't like him?
It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
No, Ma'am.
I think I can probably do that on my own.
Yeah.  It was.
What's to like?
I can't open it.
Oh God, that's great!
Long enough.
"To"... Forget about you.
You don't have to, now.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Just putting in an appearance then.
Claire...
The gun?  It's in the upstairs closet.
Get in bed.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
I can still use a gun.
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
I'd identify him.
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
She took you shopping for a tie?
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
You heard me.
I'm not saying it's your fault.
I watched TV.
No.
When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
I heard.
Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
No, I need'm now!
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
... Hard?
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
Lay back, Mack!!  What's this "lay back, Mack?"  Where does he get this?
Yeah.  She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood.  'Bye, Dad.
Take care, pal.
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
No…not really.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Yeah--
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
Mr. Jameson--
Hmf-hrr?
What if you get hurt?
Huh?
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Uh is a good start.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
Does it have a human name?
I've gotta study.
I've got no problems.
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
Oh, God, I forgot to--
Strong...
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
It'll shut itself off.
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
He'll try to finish his experiment.
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
Bonkers.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Jawohl!
There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
And maybe a little something else?
No? Aren't you a little afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound? For a tip-off like this, you know what the Krauts would pay?
Forget it.
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
What some brandy?
You won't get off that cheap.
I'll live.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
Any objections, men?
Why the south latrine?
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
Says who?
Okay, Price. You stay.
Anybody cover?
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
Check.
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
A lot of people say that and the first thing you know is they get married and live happily ever after.  I wonder what they're trying to pull out there?
Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
Ja, ja, gewiss! It is only that we are cramped for space with new prisoners every day.  Gentlemen! Outside! Please! Do you want me to have trouble with the Kommandant again!
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
Russian women prisoners?
Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
It is not me. It is the orders. I am your friend. I am your best friend here.
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
When is it expected back?
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
I believe so.
Commander.
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
Thanks.
One minute to warp core breach.
Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue. We don't even have a full crew aboard.
I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.
But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
Wherever he wanted to be.
It's our pleasure.
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
No.
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
No. Thank you.
You can't fool an empath, Captain. I know exactly when I'm needed.
In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.  Good luck.
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
Locate.
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
... How long?
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Sir...?
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
She's to be decommissioned.
I'll need it, Sulu.
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
Red alert, Mr. Scott.
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.

Because you wish it.  
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
Yes, I was...
He would not have spoken of it openly.
... The needs of the many outweigh...
I see... and I understand.  Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.
Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
Station!
I only meant, my lord, that if it's prisoners you want --  There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.
They know we would die first.
I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
<U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
I'm not a drama critic.
Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Say thank you.
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
Every time we have dealings with Starfleet, I get nervous.  We're dealing with something that COULD be perverted into a dreadful weapon. Remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with? That's exactly the --
I saw it -- !
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?
Let them eat static.
They're still running with shields down.
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
Visual --
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Do it, while we have time.
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Aye, sir.
No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
I am understandably curious.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
The power of creation --
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
In my quarters, Uhura.
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
Who?
We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Engine room! What's happening?!
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Stop engines.
<u>I did nothing</u> -- except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been --
He's very human.
We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
You do this -- for friendship?
I do this because I was there,
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
Humans make illogical decisions...
Just a couple of kooks...
What do you mean?
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
... My shoes...
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
We're just -- observing.
I was not informed about observers.
I do not know your name.
I'm wery sorry, but --
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
I was not.
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
Hm?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
... Gone?!
Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...
Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
... I see.
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes.
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
Mercy Hospital.
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
I'll have to re-energize.
Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
Do you have the right to murder?
It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
There are caves in those mountains.
Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
What's the rush?
I don't.
Perhaps, that is true.
My legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change.  I... cannot imagine... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet...
Do machines ever play?
Androids... don't have...fun.
Are they in any danger?
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
And I do not believe I made a very good first impression.
What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...
The Ba'ku.
We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
It may not last after we leave. If not, I just wanted, before we go...  I've never actually seen a sunrise.
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
If it works you mean.
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
Aye, sir.
Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
Would you like something to eat?
Gorch?
What are they interested in...?
Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
Are you saying they won't help us?
I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
At least four hours.
No... no, please... you cannot...
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
Where's the Sphere?
You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.
Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
Let's go.
They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
Jean-Luc Picard.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
Not really. I was born and raised right here. Never had much use for travel.
I can try.
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
You're lying.
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
We DO sleep lying down.
Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
We've been set up all along.
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
That's a comfort...
You feign ignorance?
There... were no other ships in the sector.
Yes.
For insubordination.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
Shields up. Battle stations.
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Thank you, Captain.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
Aye, sir.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
You have personally -
I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
LET THEM DIE.
Spock, I'm really tired...
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
Visual!
Would they?
Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.
But you didn't join a conspiracy.
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
I do not understand.
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
To new worlds...
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
Sorry, sir.
Yes, sir.
I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
Do you have a moment, sir?
Of course, sit down.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
I don't believe that, sir. We’ve shared many disappointing journeys.
I don't know.
How could I not?
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
What programs were accessed?
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
And that's exactly what he's going to do.
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
On screen.
Aye, sir
Aye, sir.
She's a predator.
He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.
I intend to.
As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
With a full head of hair.
I was lonely...
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
Long ago.
I am.
Let's go.
Yes, Praetor.
Do as I tell you!
They're holding position.
But surely...
What do you do?
You don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. I got a girl going to college this fall. The wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it.
It is beautiful.
He's got a gun!!
Where did you stop last?
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
What do you mean by 'contain?'
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
I just retired.
Watch it. They're coming out.
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
Get a highway patrol unit over there.
Ah no.
Dashboard.
Coupons.
Money.
You're full of tricks, aren't you?
I...
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
Shit!
No.
A baby is a new person?
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Yes?
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
You liked my singing?
Yes. Sing some more.
You can have one.
I don't want you to be hurt.
Come on.
We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
Nothing.
Horses.
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
What for?
I understand.  Thank you.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
What will you say about us?
Call the police!!
Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
Get Fox.
Very beautiful country up here...
Can you see under the faceplate?
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
Just not the eyes.
Yeah, right.
No problem.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
Make me forget it, baby.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
Can't do it.
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
Thanks, Max.
Shutup a second!
You should feel like shit.
I'm on her.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
He records himself raping and killing her--
W'sup, Max?
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
Come on!  If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?  Just get your butt down here.  If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room.  It's 2203.  You writin'?
What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
You got froggy on me a couple times.
So lay it off to somebody else.
Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice.
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
I always do.
Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
Define love.
Coming with you.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
No idea.
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
Wants to share.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
Now you're really getting paranoid.
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
It was a tough call.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
I know how the Feds like to sit on information. I got something in the car to show you.
You're thinking...?
Hi there.
You heard?
This is Agent Mackelway.
Smarter than us.
Another what?
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
There was talk of a file photo.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  The Deputy Director here, he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out, righto? Agent Kulok, when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers, some years ago. That's a Dave Koessler trick, find a pliant sociopath, preferably a dead one, attribute to him unsolved cases, clean up the backlog-looks great in the yearly report.
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?
Doesn't fit.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
Where's my watch? It's gone.
The other reason?
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
Not the way I can.
Jaime? Where are you?
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.
How are we going to find him?
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
The little piggie speaks.
When you exit, head east on 10th.
How's the arm?
You knew it was me all along?
Those were just fantasies.
Yeah.
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
If I owe, I will go.
[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
Yes, sir.
This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero.
You have to put things in perspective.
Ever since I've known you.
I don't know about that.
Shuddup.
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
You better pay the man.
I like quiche.
Not lately.
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
Yeah.
It does.
Like what?
What what? What advantages?
To do what?
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
...and even then...
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
No.
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
Wait... Wait... Listen... So, I check the time and place. I'm where I'm supposed to be. I call my agent... She says they asked for me specifically...
...And she's with someone else.
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
I'm a comedian.
Why not?
What do you do, Trent?
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
Listen. I had a great time.
It's not going to well?
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...well, it suits you...
...get the hell outta here already...
Yeah.
...the Michelin commercial...
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Unless she comes back first.
It's a gig.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
I've decided to get out there.  Go ahead. Play it out.
Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
There's the rub.
Him?
No. Just O.J.
Well, you're doing so well...
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
...He's derivative...
I don't know...
VEGAS.
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Let's go.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
Did she, or did she not smile.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
No!
No! Not the camera guy!
Hold on.
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
Yeah.
It starts at eight...
She didn't notice.
That doesn't matter.
They're a finesse team...
Now?
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
That's what I keep trying to tell him.  You're so money, you don't even know...
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
Sue!
...it is so on.
You don't have to wait three days...
...just be smart about it.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
You owe the Don a service.  He has no doubt that you will repay it.
Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
OK, but be careful.
Sure.
What percentages for my family?
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
This morning.
It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
Now you've had your drink.
For bravery.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
Accept what's happened, Michael.
I'll need him.
Godfather, you understand everything.
Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
Yes.
No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks...
And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.
Okay.  One minute.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
Well it's war!  We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop had Genco, who do I have?  Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be sore.
An accident.  No one was hurt.
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story.
Michael...
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
What time do they expect us?
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Can you say it?
Oh Michael.
Don't ask me.
What?
Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
Do you recognize my voice?
Is he alive?
Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come.  It's great. You're going to love it.
Okay, darling.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
Okay.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
What?
I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000.
Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
I'm prepared to take the blame.
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
That's good.
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
So tell me.
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
You love me and you're not marrying me.
What evening?
Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play?
Marge-maintenance.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to -- what's the word?  The moment someone confronts him he lashes out. He lashes out. You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't choose your children.
Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well, my boy, it's come to a pretty pass, hasn't it?
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
Bird. That's jazz.
So I'm learning.
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out --  Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
I think you're right.
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
Dickie did it.
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
And you, sir? Any better?
What?
I don't believe a single word you've said.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
I told you! I knew it!
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
I hope so.
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
Right.
How did you know that?
I know.
Beating you away.
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
A ragione. A ragione. 
Hmm. C'e questa... 
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
Do you want me to stick around?
Or I could come back.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Or Tom and Peter even.
And don't forget. I have the key.
I don't remember the exact date.
Does he stay with you here?
31 people.
I got money.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
What kind of people?
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
It keeps ya busy.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
What do you mean?
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
Can I call you?
You forgot "sexy".
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
Is he Italian?
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
Show me how he did that again.
That's fine.
That's a dollar forty-seven.
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
Where.
I have.
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
I don't like my real name.
You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.
Oh, come off it, man.
You can do it in my mouth.
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
He looks like a killer.
What's so important?
Cops don't do nothin.
How?
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
My work may take me out of New York.
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
Have you tried the telephone?
There must be something...
I've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
You would, huh?
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
What's going on?
Iris?
Show it to me.
Well, I just, you know...
Things got ya down?
The taxi life, you mean.
Like do anything, you know.
It's about time.
I'm not a fool, Billy.
Forget about all that.  You want to do the right thing?  Then defend your name.  If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so.  I know the law, and the law's on your side.
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
I wish you were coming with me.
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
You look... different.
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
Why me?
After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it.  The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall.  Everyone finally got tired of the fighting.  So they stuck it down here.
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
What did... what did I want to be?
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
I see...
No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
I do.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
Ben, when's Delly due back?
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
You think it over.  No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building.
You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor.  January seventh... nineteen forty-two.
Well, yes, that she was.  She certainly made this place a home.
"Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs."
... Ernie.
Yes?
Ha!
You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me "Dad."
This is not a bender yet.  This is the start of a bender.  But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.
I guess I did.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
Call me... Ishmael?
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
I was decorated.
Yeah, well, that's enough.
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
So, it is a blacklist.
Climb down off your cross.  They already knew about her.  She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
When was that?
Nineteen-oh-nine.
I taught you that.
Yeah... me too.
Don't mention it.  Whoever-you-are.
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
No.  Absolutely not.
Lovebirds.
Thank you.
Yes.
How'd you happen to come here?
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
Then why did she object to you?
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
I did.
That's up to you.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
They're birds!
Yes?
Where?
The two kids?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
No. Here's fine. 
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Never mind the law. Cathy, you can start serving the soup.
And certainly pretty.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
That's a chance we have to take.
I mean. I want to...
They won't be.
I started to say... inside...
No, not exactly.
Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
And if you don't?
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
I'm awfully sorry.
Lovebirds, sir?
I understand completely, sir.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
What are you? A policeman?
Do you practice here?
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
Why... 
Yes?
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
Yes.
What did it say?
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
How does Mother know what I like to do?
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
Yes.
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
What do you do?
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
Are you staying?
Really? Tell me about it.
How long have they been gathering there?
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
What time is it?
What do you suppose it is?
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
If you don't even know what you want to do...
We need them.
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of...
Good.
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
Did he tell you about Georgina?
Yes.
Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
So she told me.  I'm a teacher -- not a practitioner.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
Confound me, the child's a cripple, of course she wants to walk.  Child, I say to you get up out of that chair and walk.
Don't be a fool.  One can't begin and then stop -- and because that entry of the girl's body is in your hand, you'll do as I say. As for me, I'll tend to Gray.
He was a nice horse.
I can't.
A student.  I'm studying under Dr. MacFarlane -- that is, I've been studying until today --
Hear him?  Did you ever see the lads play knife?
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
I take no gifts from you.
Get out of here!
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
Another little drop'll never do you any harm.
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
"Nor did they handle axe or knife To take away their victim's life -- No sooner done than in a chest They crammed their lately welcome guest."
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
Tell her... we'll get him.
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
This is not just some "thing." It's A C zero zero five.
I know her friends.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful.
No. You don't.
He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
I do. Every day.
What did I say?
Just hold on to me.
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
No.
About you.
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
Not yet. That's why I wanted to see you.
These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
What do you mean, dear?
Yes, I have!
Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
Yes -- I think so.
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
She doesn't like me to steal from people.
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
I'm afraid my people haven't.  I'm very sorry -- I wish it were otherwise.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery.
Zero.
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
They pulled a mind-scramble on us, man!  It wasn't our fault! They opened their eyes and talked!
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
For a ride.
Yeah.
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
Chill out Edgar.
What happens in tow and a half hours?
When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
He's not breathing, Mom.
I'll hitch.
No.  I'm up.
Grandpa has plans of his own.  Michael, I want you to do this. Everybody has been bending over backwards for you.  You come home late.  You sleep in to the middle of the day -- Sam is always alone. You do exactly what you want... tonight do what I want for a change.
Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later.  Grandpa's expecting us.
I thought we were poor.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Can we get a T.V.?
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
But, Mom...
Lucy.
-- a job.
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...
I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.
Well... what do I know?  I'm a bachelor.  Lucy... this is going to be a very special night, I promise you.
It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
Me, too.
I was here first.
Entertain yourself.
What would that make Mom?
Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
Just for a few days, Sam.  Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
No, I... I don't mean infection... or disease...
I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!
No, you're not!  I don't trust any of you!
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
Was dark... find a light...
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
When we were up poking around his place... I found this...
I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
What for?
All in Norwegian.
Well, get to it.
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
What for?
Who else could have used that key?
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
MacReady, that you?
Around here.
You know of them?
But you escaped.
You'll live like this forever. Alone.  You were meant to help.  To be with people.  Not like this.
Yes.
It frightens you.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
As slaves.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
A man can change his history.
I'm a foolish man.
I just love mechanical things.
I need to... um... talk to you.
I need... to talk to you.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
You sound like my father...
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
Then why are you here?
It wasn't your fault, Alex.
I can't do that --
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
That's absurd --
Thank you...
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
Yes...
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
Your husband is dead?
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Every night.
We share everything.
I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done.  I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
You know this?
Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path.  We're on the carriage path.
Yes.
I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
That'll be all.
He said he traveled for two months.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
What do you mean?!
They've gone to a better place.
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
Then don't.
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
[Pointedly] Of course you're not.
I don't give a shit about your patient!
Yes.
You may have known my father, William Starks.
They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
They should just be looking harder.
Yeah.
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
[Beat] What?
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
How'd he die?
If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
They're not.
It's Sunday.
[Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.
Ok.
I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
[Beat] I don't know.
My dad wrote some things down before he died.
[Beat] Yeah, it is.
This has nothing to do with that.
Well, what time is it?
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
Listen to me. That's all I ask.
I tried something like 30 times. There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to that.
I wasn't talking about anything.
I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
No.
Great, get in. We'll switch off in a bit.
[Beat] Thanks.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
Of course you don't know.
Do you have a motel or something? Money?
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
Yup. That's me.
You like it?
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
[Beat] Why?
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
Yes, baby?
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
What?
Why?
On what?
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
You want to come on in?
Just some young guy.  Around twenty years old.  Dark hair.
The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
What?
You're a little angle, you are.
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie Randall.  You'd know him if you saw him.  His brother was in your class. Terry.
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Yes.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
Get the car!
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
Actin' like what?!  How am I supposed to act?  'Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody's head off!
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
It's probably not a good idea.
He said "Okay, Thelma.  I just wanted to know you were alright.  I hope you're havin' a good time.  You sure deserve one after puttin' up with me all the time.  I love you, honey."
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Try to.
I want you to call Darryl.
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
No physical evidence.  We can't prove he did it.  We probably can't even prove he touched you by now.
Let's get it over with.
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
Now, Thelma, that is not...
Suck my dick... Boom!!
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
I know.  I know what you mean.  I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
What?
About two hundred and fifty miles.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
You, too, sweetie, the best.
Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games with you. I could give you a song and dance but what's the point? I did it and we all know it.  The hitcher himself told me it's illegal. The irony...
That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
Never?
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
'That right?
Nepal? Have you been?
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Pat Healy.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
Lint?
-- Love story of our time.
Come on, what were you going to say?
All you want is a phone number?
You want her dead, don't you?
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
So she hasn't changed?
Anyway, the good news is I have all the information you need. Got it from her bookie -- nice guy. You should definitely call her, Ted. I mean she's a real sparkplug, that one. She seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help I'll bet she does it.
Uh, that's okay.
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
Do what?
You're a sick man, you know that?
That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever get the great girl? Give the big pig with the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick of it, man! No more -- it was my turn. It was time for me... time for me... to be happy.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Uh, sort of nouveau Deco... with a big vestibule. Check it out next time you're up there.
Who?
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
Nice.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!
'That right? Good for you.
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
It means you're too hard on guys.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
I appreciate you looking out for me.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
No, it's an old football injury.
Really? I never got a message.
That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
On your ear, you've got something.
Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
I don't know... My friends think I'm too picky. I think I'm just a weirdo magnet. I did come close once -- just last year, in fact. There was this guy he lived in San Francisco.
Why not?
I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again.
Mary, come on...
Okay.
Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie.
It.
Teddy, be brave.
Is that bubble what I think it is?
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
Uh-huh.
Giddy-up.
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is --
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
What's gotten into you?
Something your father would've come up with.
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
I think it's a bad idea.
Still heading for Cuba.
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Okay, Ken. We're going.
Will somebody find out what's going on?!
Hey. Nice tie.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
James Looks Twice?
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
Goodbye.
Ray.
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.
She's that subtle?
-- Cooch. Woh. Stop.
The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.
What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
Let the press through.
Bullshit.
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
He said he doesn't know.
Because he was talking to me.
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
A what?
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
What the fuck you talkin' about?
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
You saw a MiG 21?
It's classified.
Lieutenant...
I'm starting to sense that now.

You're an animal.
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
Why?
In that order?
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
Now?
...Something like that.
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M GONNA EJECT.
What is he doing?
You.
Were upside down!
We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
Saving them some paperwork.
BREAKING LEFT!
AND HE'S GUNNING.
Yawing right.
I know!
Okay.
I'm not losing it again!
Just relax.
Well what?
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
Why do they call you Wolf?
On what?
This is Maverick.
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
I want him!
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in the...
Well, you'll just have to make do with him .
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
What now?
WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2
Need a hint?
I think I can work it out on my own.
But you continued to fight.
Three guesses.
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
The flying. The fighting.  I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good.  Just give me the jet.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. But I have responsibility for the other guys up there, not just you. They need to know you're all right...that they can depend on you.
Would you take me back? Would they?
I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
You're getting off to an early start.
Why not?
Thank you.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
Sorry.  Too perfect.
Perfect, my ass!  --You pop your memory cap before we can activate you.  Then Richter goes hod wild, screwing up everything I spent a year planning. --Frankly, I'm amazed is worked.
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
You tell me.
I don't know.
They sell fake memories.
Oh, Rekall.
Let me buy you a drink.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
Come on!
Thanks for taking Johnnycab.
Lori, I don't believe it...You're jealous of a dream!
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
All right, forget about it.
There's lots nicer places than Mars.
Bye.
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
And falling in love?
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
Good to see ya. Right this way.
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
Okay, you're the boss -- Mars it is.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
No options.
I love you.
I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Inside what?
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
I used to model for 'em, why?
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
Heather and I are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town.
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
No problem.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
You can't fight'em that way...
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
Burt, can you hear me now?
Just barely, Pham.  What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on?  Come back.
In a minute.
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
You're really leaving, huh?
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
Hell you did.  Your turn.
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
Yeah, sure.  Go ahead and plan it...for a year or two.
You got that right.
I am not!
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!
I'm gonna help you.
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
What?
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
You okay?
Why do you all keep asking me?
Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
Not necessarily...
You fucking swear to shut up!
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
We're taking the other case.
What other case?
I don't know but it makes one hell of an opening statement.
Eddie... I don't know about this...
-- Yeah?
A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
I followed her from the courthouse.
Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
That's right.
Want to tell me what went down here?
Well I know that you're innocent, Shu -- even if you forgot.
By trusting me. Shit, man...
I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial.
The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
I want you to kill for me.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
You killed Mike.
Don't get funny with me again.
Bobby...
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
You are here and there is no place to go...
Where's Hap?
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
What do you mean?
Maybe, later we could take a look.
May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Laura, I am your friend.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.
Maybe.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
I'm not.
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
Why? It does.
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
What do you mean?
Oh, Laura.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
No.
What are you afraid of? What people think?
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
What were you doing in my room?
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
Fine.
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
Did you come home during the day last week?
I can arrange that. I like that.
Who am I?
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
You know what that would mean?
It's a crime.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
I... yes.
Just as you are, Sir...
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
I'm just an M.D.
How is that?
When she...
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course...
Well, many reasons, actually...
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
Yes... I... yes.
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
The most respected...
Hi. How are you doing?
A single hour.
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
That happens.
Listen to me, fella...
Mr. Concannon...?
Still looking.
And what are you? A cop?
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
Isn't there something you...
What is that to you...?
What are you going to do?
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I can't guarantee that...
I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
Then why don't you testify?
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
It's locked?
...But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right.
That's for sure, Frank.
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
What do you want?
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
Right.
Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
Yeah. I'm awake.
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
How old are you, how many children... when did you last eat...
The Hospital...?
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
Yes, the roving nurse...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
We'd be in all the papers!
I didn't know how to stop you...!
There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
Sure...get in!
I liked him.
Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
Don't let's lose each other.
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
It was nearer than that.
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
More or less.  Dylan, time to get dressed.  I'm late.
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
Guess so.
No.
No...
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Not sleepy.
When do you think it'll be done?
Really?  Hell, if having a screwy family made you crazy, the world'd be one colossal nuthouse.
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
Really?
I'm afraid there was an accident.  It appears he fell asleep while driving, ma'am.
I want to see for myself.
Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
Captured?  How?
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
On the deck of the Yankee, the night you asked me to marry you.  We weren't much older than they are.
I haven't forgotten.
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
I didn't know sir.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
Fifteen.
Thank you.
I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.
Yeah.  How'd you do.
Congratulations.
What about you?
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
Because it looks good.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
Fine.
I couldn't.
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
No.
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
Yes.  I do.
I couldn't do it.
Outer.
Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
What?
About yourself?
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
Aaauuuhhh!!!
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
... Absolutely not.
Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody.
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
Why? He's right in the groove.
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
You black?
Why not?
Feed store keeps up to five K in their safe. Need me a good boy for back-up. Even split. You interested?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
Have now.
You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass?
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
Yeah, I suppose. But you know somethin' baby, hair does make a difference.
You up for that?
What'd you say to her?
Told her my name. Then she said somethin' like, 'It's so noisy down here. Why don't we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves?' She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day.
We got through two states already.
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Come look at this.
Honey, we're goin' to bed now and it's time to change the subject.
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Under a hundred.
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
Fan works.
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Come sit by me.
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
I mean tomorrow.
What?
Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
Course I am, mama.
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
You need to explain it.
That's your business... I don't care how.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
What?
Please Santos... Where's Johnnie?
It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
You heard right.
Life is unpredictable.
He's right, you look horrible.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
She's a transvestite.
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
I just mean...
I know. He started it Fall semester.
Not Curtis.
Competence.
Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
Ye-es?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
Evidently.  Coming!
Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs...  Improvise. You're good at that.
And your wife left you.
Who's got a gun?
No, really...
Shoot.
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
No. Sara, you don't understand...
How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.
...You carry firearms.
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
Really.
Right.
Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now.
I had to. Didn't I?
What are we going to do with...
Miss Sloviak's.
Is he all right?
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
There is, but it's not that interesting.
Yeah, well, actually...
Jesus, James. Wow.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
When we fall, we fall hard.
Amazing.
James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
The hell I am.
In a minute. Get us a table.
I eat.
Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.
Well, let's see if we can keep that from happening.
That strikes me as odd.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
No, it's not that, it's...
Has he asked to see the book yet?
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
Is the thing -- is it over?
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
I love you, Grady.
Really? That was fast.
I'm kidding. Hello?
And the jacket?
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
Are you sure you parked it there?
And what did you say?
I'm through improvising.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
I told Walter.
Does he still love you?
What's that?
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
I'm in love with your wife.
Thanks -- Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful here...
Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Early July.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
You don't have to tell me this.
Did you ever... Do you have feelings for Anna?
Birds.
In that birch tree is a nest.
It's just a city park.
Well... not in the common way.
They grow outside, don't they?
I fell asleep.
I don't know.
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
No.
I could take you downtown.
I'm twelve.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
Do you want me to sit on your lap?
They could be finches. I don't know. We should go before it gets dark.
I know because... it's just something I know.
You should go home.
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
Why not?
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Bad idea.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
Reflect.
You have no feelings for your niece?
Then why are you talking about this?
Have to talk about something.
We have a few more minutes.
How do you define it?
What is your idea of being normal?
I want to be normal!
Is this the first one?
Go home, Walter.
Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
That's my answer.
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
I see my sister.
Where?
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
You felt pleasure.
Yes.
I was six years old!
What picture?
People without cars.
Guess I'm not like most women.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
What do you think?
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
You think I have a problem?
I thought I'd stay the night.
What for?
Yeah.
Molested little girls?
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
How many girls did you molest?
How young?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
I was always the one seduced.
Most people say the odds are against me.
The percentages --
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
All three -- in chronological order.
You must hate your brothers.
Not ever?
Us seeing each other.
Prove it.
Nothing.
Fucking liar.
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
Where're you?
Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
How deep's the drop-off here?
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up to fight.  You--
Who else?
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name is Michael.
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
Not in this thing.
You noticed.
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us.  We better get this flooding stopped.
I don't know how!
No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
What's the plan?
I've been better.  Next time it's your turn, okay?
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins.
Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
All right.  Do it!
We're here now.  Let's get her done.
Okay, here we go.  Start equalizing, y'all.
Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins? Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has known about them for years.  They abduct people all the time.  There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who--
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
There will be plenty of time to talk about it later.  We'll  get married  soon.  That way we'll have more time...
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
More so than the shark?
And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
Oh, Sandro...
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
And what about you?
I don't know about that. And then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays?
Why?
Have you ever been in love?
What do you mean by sensible?
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
To the shark.
Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.
I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
But you have to  consider all possibilities, Sandro.
Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
Now listen, if I had any information, I wouldn't have come here to ask you. But I see that you, too, lack any information ...
Through someone else?
Agnes...
Look at the statues, they're thin.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
Yes, of God.
Why?
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
Why?
Let's talk about something else.
What would you like to talk about.
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
He's told you?
Something I ate.
Then let's talk about something else...
Agnes...
Do you have any children?
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.
Do you believe she really saw them?
She'd get angry.
Like you?
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
I'm not sick.
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Her headaches.
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Why were you afraid?
Did anyone else know about the baby?
I can't tell you that.
I'm afraid.
Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby?  Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that night.
Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
What do you feel?
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
Go away, I don't want you here.
Do you remember what just happened?
I want you to remember if you can a night last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember.
What did she mean?
And the passage to the barn?
So I could go to him.
Where?
Yes.
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
Agnes who did you see?
Of course you do. Who was it?
I hate him.
I don't remember.
Yes.
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
If I find anything I'll call you.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
I can get you new evidence next week.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
Unfiltered.
Why haven't you asked her?
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
What's your opinion?
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
How?
Yes.
What is it?
What sheets?
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
About what?
Do you know what she did to her?
I don't think I care to know.
I haven't decided yet.
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Saint Peter?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
For the Church?
That's what I have to believe...
Somebody told her.
Why would I lie?
If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
My God, but you're determined.
That's a lie.
You tied the cord around its neck.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
Shurrup!
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Well --
Yeah?
Read 'em!
But I suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long...
They'll be here.
I see you go to the night court.
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
But I won't.
It is, y'know.
Ah well. Eh, look!
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
Yes, you're quite a feather in the cap.  Hello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him.  Of course, right away.
Sorry.
Follow your impulse.
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
Come here.
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Oh, it's the way you talk.
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
A book!
You're only right.
That's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.
Is there a fire, then?
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... 
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Oh, I see.
He's got you worried, then?
Foreign devil ...
You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!
No, I'm not.
You are.
I knew I could rely on you.
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
That's too easy for Lennon.
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
What?
Nerves.
And they want me?
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
Where the hell are we?
Drop begins... now!  Fifteen kilometers and dropping... twelve... ten... eight and slowing.  Five. Three.  Two.  One kilometer and slowing.  Lock tractor beams.
No, you'll follow me.
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
Unknown.
Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.
That way.
Is it alive?
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
Here, let me try.
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
Well we better do something.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.
Maybe it wasn't always dead.
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
Good!  That's good!
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
I can't, the acid will pour out!
No.
We're not going anywhere.
It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
Let's let the machine work on him.
Is it still dripping?
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Any microorganisms?
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
Still worried?
But why draw it on the wall?
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
Now what?
Right now let's keep it closed.
Can we get to him?
No such luck.  I saw it running down one of the corridors.
Who gets the privilege?
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
Kill me...
Sure.
Do you want a tablet?
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
Oh man...
It's on the board.
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
Keep trying!
We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
Has anybody talked to them?
But...
What?
I'm picking up another signal.
Thanks.
Done it already.  Nothing matches.
What is that?
Four.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
No!
We won't disturb her rest. It seems she left her award in the taxicab. Will you give it to her?
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
And what is your name?
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
Eddie...
Just like it.
Stars.
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
What of it?
Yes, Addison.
Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it...
Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.
Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
Hear, hear...
Then you two must have a long talk-
Being violently ill to her tummy.
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
Just slipped your mind.
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
And cut that out right now.
You in a hurry?
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
Sure! Like the Western Union boys used to do...
Yeah... I will.
I love you too. Good night, darling-
This is my house, not a theater! In my house you're a guest, not a director-!
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
I don't think that's funny!
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
Nothing, really...
So full of meaning, fire and music!
Who?
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
Now don't get carried away-
Tell that to Dr. Freud! Along with the rest of it...
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
I wish it were.
I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.
A cowboy.
I told you a lie. We'll make it easily. Margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut.
I just wondered.
Why.
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little...
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
Find out.
The same size?
Oh, brother.
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
Well...
It couldn't possibly interest you.
Tell me, Eve - how are things with you? Happy?
The show must go on.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
You won't forget it?
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
I don't intend to be.
Why shouldn't you?  Please sit down.
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
You've really got a low opinion of me, haven't you? We'll I'll give you some pleasant news. I've been told off in no uncertain terms all over town. Miss Channing should be happy to hear that. To know how loyal her friends are - how much more loyal they are than she had a right to expect me to be...
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
I'd do much more - for a part that good.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
Not at all...
The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
No trouble at all.
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
Peace and quit is for libraries.
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. Without that, you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman...  ... slow curtain. The end.
Very classy stuff, lots of technique-
That's on time for Margo.
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
Incredible.
What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
That's quite a change of subject.
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
Now just a minute!
The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
Such as?
That was way back...
Where is she?
Shucks. And my autograph book is at the cleaners.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
She was a revelation...
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
Too bad.
I mean really, deeply angry...
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
Would you?
Anything to help you out, Max.
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
I promise.
That's my Max.
--read 'em both and you'll see--
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
The fucking New York Times.
--I'm trying--
Were you eyebrow reading?
You're not a kid anymore.
Facts or theory?
We appreciate your position--really.
You voted for him.
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
--just that a lot of reports were sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name who, not here anyway--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--I haven't said anything--
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
--Haldeman I know, who else?
So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
What's the matter?
Hmm?
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
--Teddy Kennedy?
Mind if I try?
When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
Sure--off the record.
--so?
--yes--
Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
It's right under that pile.
Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
Sloan knew which five, didn't he? 
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
Who by?
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
Go on.
It's not that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me, or that everything we print the White House denies, or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff.
Is he on the level of Assistant to the President or not?
You don't mind getting on people's nerves, do you?
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
James McCord.
Will you step forward, sir. 
Security consultant.
Where?
I think so.
When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
Just that on his office wall there's a cartoon with a caption reading, "When you've got them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow."
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
You're a killer, Ozzy!
-- Thanks, coach --
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
Single malt?
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
You don't like it?
That's nice.
You want onions?
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
You called me Oz.
I know, it sucks!
What?  We both have cars.
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
So, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Exactly three weeks to the day.
Yeah, enormous.
I'll save you a seat.
That's stupid.
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
Dad, come in.
Do you know about the clitoris?
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Michelle.
I told you.
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
Tonight?
Okay.
It did.
No, Kevin --  That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing.  That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
Does it tell me how to get laid?
Ready for what?
What?!  How do I do that?
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
She works part-time at my dad's store.
Dude, he does not.
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
Also like sex with my wife.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it?
I know! Let's go hock loogies off the Eiffel Tower!
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
I don't know...
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal?  Shake a paw?
Really.
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
You too.
Before the coma!
What?!
Oh no... no....
Yeah?
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
Claude.
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
He says -
Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris.  We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris. 
That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
No!
It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
How do you know?
Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...
Bartok... a question.
Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
Pray he's color-blind...
No. Empress, you --
I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
She does.
I had nothing to do with it!
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
Why not?
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Well, no... not just, not only.
Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, whatta-  whatta dumb thing to say, right? I mean, you say it, "You play well," and right away... I have to say well. Oh, oh... God, Annie.  Well... oh, well... la-de-da, la-de- da, la-la.
I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Wisconsin.
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Huh?
Huh? Oh, yeah.
You want your tennis stuff?
Oh.
Yeah, my grammy.
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
Sure, I got... I got nothing, uh, nothing till my analyst's appointment.
...and... uh, yeah, uh... uh, you know, I-I-I...
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Fifteen years, huh?
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
think that's, uh-
No, so help me.
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
And we'll digest our food better.
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
Those are the two categories...
Yeah.
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
You don't want me to live with you?
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
Hey, don't be ridiculous.
'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Oh, come, you don't need that.
C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
M'hm.
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
Whatta you mean? Me?
Will it change your wife?
Will it change my life?
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
Oooh.
It was just great!
Oh, humdinger. When- Well, I got a wonderful idea. Why don'tcha get the guy who took you to the rock concert, we'll call him and he can come over and kill the spider. You know, it's a-
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Yeah.
Okay, okay. Okay.
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
Yeah, but it's real close.
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
This is my room.
What'd I do?
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
I did.
Why are you so hostile?
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
Dammit! I was so close.
Are you?
I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
Trigger.
Hey.
Right before his un-American thing.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Just give me the license, please.
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Ah, Max, you, uh...
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
You all right?
You wanna lie down?
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
Hi. How do you do.
Yeah. Right.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
Di-diabetes? Is that any excuse? Diabetes?
She's a colored woman, from Harlem!
I look pretty.
Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
We really had a good time.
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
I don't know. I don't know.
Yeah.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
Scratch the two, write in a four.
It's alright, isn't it?
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
Well, probably.
I'll change back before we leave.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?
Can I open it?
Oh, very jealous.
Let's go upstairs, okay?
Oh.  You're them.
Forget it, Judy.
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
A perfect night.
Hey!  Would you?
I don't think so.
Probably not.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
They're paying him scale.
Scout's honor.
Hardly...
We're great.
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
It's a novel.
What are you saying?
I don't look my age, Joe.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
I'll never forgive you.
I guess.
Me too.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
It's a novel.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
Ah there's our snookums now.
Sally did all this herself?
Oh.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
Lemon.
I think he's really angry with me too.
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
Excuse me?
Let's just go home, okay?
Oh?
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
Do you need anything else?
No, no thanks.
Yeah.
If he were still alive, maybe.
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
Will champagne help?
Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me.
You see, that's worse.
Okay.
You know it's true.
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
The both of you.
And the food sucks, I know.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
I don't have a drug problem.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Really?
Yes.
How should <u>I know</u>?
I <u>didn't</u> choose him.  What kind  of <u>idiot</u> would...  ...<u>choose</u> who she wanted to marry?
Wait, I hear something!
And only you can become a Queen?
Superior numbers, kid!
Good.  You're a good soldier.
No, sir!
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
I can't think of any.
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
Oh!
I've been here twice as long as you have --
I sort of like it.
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
Oh, I never catch colds.
That makes me feel just terrible.
Why?
Really?
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
What gave you that idea?
No -- I like it.
Why?
I know. I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel.
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
Where's my dress? I have to go home.
Oh -- of course. I think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.
No -- I don't want anything.
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
Someone from the office.
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
A bad insurance risk?
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Do I have to?
I just want some fresh air.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
A what?
Over a girl?
In the knee?
Yes, nurse.
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
You usually eat alone?
What?
I don't?
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
Seven --  -- queen.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
What kind of joint are you running?
Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --
How would you like to go tonight?
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
Swap them? For what?
I am?
Thank you, sir.
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
Yes, sir.
No key!
No I didn't.
You?
What do you want?
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
Something like that.
Just as long as she's okay.
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
No.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
Kubelik.
What gripes me is the two of them were guzzling my champagne while Sylvia and I wound up at the Guggenheim Museum.
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?
Dreyfuss.
I took sleeping pills.
Come on, Fran.
Will you excuse me?
What for? You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.
Always happy to do something for our girls in uniform.
I missed you, Fran.
I don't believe you.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
Fran --
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
Now, Fran --
Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
Merry Christmas.
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
The nerve.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Yeah.
Sit down -- we'll talk about it.
Part.
None.
What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
No shit.
Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
Not a thing.
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
Beats me -- the sun was too much for him, or the mud. Who knows ?
I'll go with him --
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
Listen.
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
This gentleman or myself ?
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
You'll get blown outta here some day.
We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
That's right, sir.
I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
What's the furthest you been in?
Can you trust them?
I met him.
He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
I'm Kurtz.
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Yes...
I'm taking you back.
Yes, I know...
Both of us...
Then let's get the hell out of here.
He's a man who knows what he wants -- he does know what he wants.
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
That's me.
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
C'mon --
Wait 'til I'm across!
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
Back against the bars.  Now.
Can't be.  Too keen a sense of this place in your pictures.
He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
What's going on?
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
You got one?
Don't bet on it.
You don't know how true that is.
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
Where's the kid?
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
Uh-huh.
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Yes.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
Spence.
You all set here?
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
No!!! Stay away from me!
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Just how grateful I am.
I want you to go on this trip.
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Are you still coming?
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
Nonsense!
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
Never.
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
To hell with sex.
Okay. Good-bye.
Were you asleep?
Why? What have you been thinking about?
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
What the heck do you mean?
You changed the room around...
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
What?
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
Maybe this can wait.
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
It smells like shit in here?
Yeah...
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
I'm coming.
Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
I forgot to lock the door.
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
No shit.
Yeah.
Just do your job.
Two years.  Two long fucking years.
Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a fucking genius.  They said he shaded you over and over.  And in the end, he aced you again.  Shaded and faded.  They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit.  I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right?
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
Sick.  The flu.
I'm worried about you, Robert.
A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
Turn off the engine.
So this is something between you and him?
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
Rath.  Robert Rath.
Better than playing with yourself.
Why didn't you finish this game?
You were like a boy genius?
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
Because I want to know.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
After that?
I don't.
Why not?
Here?
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
Taiwan.
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
That means you won't have a gun.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
I don't believe that.
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
I know.  It makes me crazy.
Attraction is a complication?
It happened to you before?
Who was she?
Was she the only one?
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
When did it start?
Uh-huh.
I'm taking off my mike.
Yes.
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
Electra --
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
Sure.
Why not?
You're pretty famous aren't you?
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
Why didn't you fade?
I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
And not even then sometimes.
What did the beer cost?
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
No "if's" or "but's" it's a cinch. Do you want to know what the icing is?
We could make a run for it?
You got my word on it.
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
I thought that was part of the charm!
Yep, except a name for this place.
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
We don't speak Czech!
Who put a bee up your butt?
When your ready Son!
Both, see you later.
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
I should have read the fine print.  I love you Holly, thanks.
Here!
What?
No, by road?
Yeah, pretty well.
No!
They didn't look like medical files to me.
Here's the details.
Yeah, maybe.
Ooh, well excuse me.
Nonsense, we can pick up the tram on the other side, it won't take any longer. Come on!
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
I hope so!
Great. And your all set for the performance?
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
Yo, dobree!
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
No, it should be over soon.
Alright!
Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more money?
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
It was the biggest I could find.
No!
I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.
Release Mr Greenwell's possessions.
Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will drive you home.
And a fifty foot extension lead?
What for?
It's more than what you're worth.
Yeah and you're a slut, so what?
Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.
With you.
Heart be still.
And I have no idea why.
Were you with Jamie?
Yeah.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
'They won't.'
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
Do you think I'm strange?
There is no point. You live. You die. The end.
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
I'm really glad you think so.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.
It means you can do anything.
I heard what you did. Thank you.
What?
That what's happening to you, only faster?
I was twelve.
Hoped for it.
No. Why? Are you seducible?
Yes, one of many.
Pull over.
Where? Why?
I will.
Now? We just --
I was going to fake it.
Lower. Same page.
Better. I was really angry.
Because you have hope that you'll get better?
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
Fine. But I need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life.
I thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship.
It was a play.
Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
Learn anything?
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
Seventeen.
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
Okay, then!
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
Run out of gas?
Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
What?
...To be traveled through
Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
You know me?
What if you lost your keys?
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Curious... Very curious....
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
It could happen at the moment you arrive back in the future, theoretically, it could happen at the moment of your birth...or conception. Actually, it could happen at any time. It's a question to which I hope we'll never learn the answer.
Dick? Dick who?
No, he showed me one.
He never bit me.
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
Mmmmm.
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
Sure.
No, you're not either.
You love him?
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
Holly.
Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
What?
Well, I got homework.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
But it would hurt.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
Yeah.
We're going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
Not really.  This is pretty important.
Where's the professor?
What? How do you know that?
Don't shoot!
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
Everybody okay up here?
Go away.  Let me rot?
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
Who?
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
She was killed, Penny.
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
Cause Buckaroo needs me here.
Flying to Cambodia.
Bet I do.
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
...I know this must look... funny.
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Before what?
Stop it, Bill!
Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.
What else?
Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
He's a great writer –
Take my copy. You're the toast of Broadway and you have the opportunity to redeem that for a little cash – strike that, a lot of cash.
Go ahead, son.
Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
That's all right, really, thank you.
Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
What kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?
And I could tell you some stories –
Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine – you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor – though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong – Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Course not, compadre. You'll see me again.
You gotta believe me –
Hold on –
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
But I didn't do it – don't you believe me?
You're in pictures, Barton. Even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you.
Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy – like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...
Yes sir, they –
I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
Don't you wanna go to your room?!
The others are being sent.
No kidding, bright boy – we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
Would that be good enough for ya?
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
All of which he's now missin'.
But, you know, with the head still on.
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
No.
A couple days ago.
Did you find out about her parents?
You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
Yes.
Thank you.
Yes.  I care about you.  I did it for you.
What was she like in school?
Are you arresting me?
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
That's right.
Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies.  For my writing.
They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop.
Yeah.  Would you like to come up and have a drink?
Why not?
Not me.
Ice?
What's it about?
To see if he can get away with it.
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
She's seen everything before.
It hurts.
Do you think I told her to kill You?
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
Why?
I'll convince you.
Did you?  What's she doing?
I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
What are you researching?
I'm writing a book.
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
Why not?
You're my friend, Gus.
Which one you talkin' about now, son?  We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
Can there be some mistake?
Why, so you could humiliate me?
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
Let's get out of here.
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
That's good. At least they're interested.
We can do better. It needed more white.
People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit!
I know that. Don't let him get away.
I didn't see you.
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
Yes, but as a black painter –
You're not?
No, I'm Haitian-Puerto Rican.
Yup.
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called – hmmm...  – yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Still not here.
Don't give him anything, man. Your art's worth a lot. Trade. That's what real artists do with each other. Besides, he'll just use you. He's famous for that.
I ain't John Henry.
Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
You want some?
Think so?
You mean babies with you?
You're your own baby.
Don't you think he's using you?
Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
You only want one Big Mac?
I don't eat junk food.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
I will relay the message.
Hanging on every word.
Good joke.  Wanna hear another one?
What're you really after?
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
No.  No glass on the inside.
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne.
Thanks.
Oxbridge Academy?
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
Divide and conquer.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
What are you talking about?
Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
<		Maybe it's something in the water.
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
I knew you could handle it.
What say we turn up the heat?
What do you mean?
Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
_No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time.
How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...?
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
And another name for Mystery?
Tonight's a good night.
Al?
And you are?
Last night at the circus. I noticed something about Dent. His coin. He's obsessed with justice. It's his Achilles' heel. It can be exploited.
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
I said I'm sure he did.
Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
And now....
You want me close but you won't let me near. What's the terrible, dark secret you're protecting everyone from?
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
I don't want to remember!
You do know. Try.
What?
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
Don't bogart that 'trode.
You sunk my battleship.
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
... A hundred and eight?
Well -- I think you might consider
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  Untraceable. It's very elegant.
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
... We could try that.
I wish you'd...
Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
Finding out where she is.
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all you expert sources.
WHAT?
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
What are you, scared of heights?
No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
Is that what you "heard"?
I've considered that possibility.
A visual record, yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
Yeah. Deja vu.
You okay?
Your face smells like a foot.
David, I'm serious!
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
Yes.  Great.  Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.
About Charles...
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
Night.
oh dear.
Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
You're an innocent and an optimist David - that's why I love you. .  Jesus - what a terrible tie- Come on, the Governor's coming at 3. And before then I have a little surprise for you and the Boss.
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
We have.  In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.
Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
And a car.
Sean Connery.
Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...
What's gone?
Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.
What's your problem Beavis?
Nnnnaah...We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Yeah! We're with the bureau of cigarettes and chicks! We're gonna score!
Bunghole...
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
Oh, that's nice.
Thrr...
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
Almost.
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
But he didn't.  We've got him where we want him.
Really.  I don't know.
Just one daughter.
Are you Juno, our case worker?
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
They're dead.
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
He's your cousin.
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
Let me have it.
They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!  It doesn't matter what brand.
Tried to convince me that this house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids. Kids!  I love them.
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
Maybe Charles does.
What happened to the people who used to live here?
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
Yes.
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
No, Eve... I'm sorry.
Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Yes.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
I am a very good gardener.
Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get to see him.
Yes. I was.
So am I, Eve.
Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
How is Ben feeling?
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
Yes. That could be true.
To watch...? To watch me...?
... But I've never done...  ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...?
I see.
Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover.  Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
I understand.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
A flower...
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
I want to tell Eve.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Yes.
Yes. I have seen styles on television.
Good day, Sally.
I see.
Is his back feeling better?
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
I am a very serious gardener.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
Correct.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
Yes. I will.
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
It's not that, I just...
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
Yes, sir.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
Well, Ben... I...
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
Take care of yourself, Ben.
John Makel...
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Hi.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
Yeah. You want a beer?
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
We'll talk about it in the car.
Don't crowd me, Craig.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
You've always loved the animals.
What's that?
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
The monkey.
I'm sorry for everything.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
I know.
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Yex?
I am a trained performer.
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
You married?
Yikes.
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
I'll protect you, Dollface.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
That's right, Wendy, it is against floor policy, but as long as you're here, let me tell you what I know about our cute little door friend. Many years ago, this very office was occupied by a kindly old watchmaker named Mr. White.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
Can I be anyone I want?
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
Count me in.
No you mustn't, my child.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
Yes, Hi.
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
I love you, Lotte.
I have to see you.
Great then.
Whatever you're having.
Do you mind?
I'm getting better all the time.
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!
Derek Mantini!
What want ye, girl child?
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
Know it, and go on out the yard. Go on.
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
You on your way home?
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
May I come in?
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
Well, come on in. You letting in flies.
I miss her.
Fine. But what would I do at night?
In case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad I can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. Anything.  Don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
No, let her rest.
Won't you be late for work?
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Go upstairs I said!!
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
Was over to Baby Suggs.
The church!
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
I don't know him that well.
Ella.
He knew Baby Suggs?
That's so.
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
I don't want to know.
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Yeah, okay.
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
Her life is in your hands.
Shit.
NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS- OF- BITCHES--
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
We have the urn.
I'm going home, Donny.
I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
What--
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
Went alright.  Dude's car got a little dinged up--
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
I've had a--
Uh-huh.
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
Heh-heh--
Far from it.
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
You mean coitus?
Well--sure, I could do that--
A hundred.
Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a good man, and thorough.
Now I got--
From who?
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
Finder's fee?
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
But he's--
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
That's the simple part, Dude.  When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat  it out of him.
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
Walter--
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
Yeah.
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Look, man, did you--
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
Dude?
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
Wha.
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS!
Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!
Who is this?
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?
Fuckin' A.
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
Walter!
Bullshit. Walter!
He's half yours, partner.
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
The House of Pain.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
What?
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
I don't like it.
I'm not giving you a choice, old man.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Just do it, old man.
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
Am I? You think the humans will ever accept a half-breed like you? They can't. They're afraid of you.  The humans fear us because we're superior. They fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
You're blind --
Show me.
You used me as bait?!
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
Blade --
Some. It's been slow --
How long have we been driving?
Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
Deacon brought me back.
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
You.
You've been listening in the whole time?
I'll take my chances.
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
What do you mean?
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
Your body, your call.
--Cotter's--
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
The, uh, blur there.
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
Turn the tapes back on.
Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
Shut-up.
Too busy eating us?
Just go.
Hey, hon'--this is what pays the rent and tuition.
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
Anna's the witch.
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
We're all going to be if you don't hit the brakes.
--now there.
I think it's time to get out of here.
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
--it's less than four feet, just--
--shit!!!
And what's your excuse for being here?
--a <u>lot</u>.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Not that I've seen--but that has no meaning--that means nothing.
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
Who <u>is</u> this??
No.
I am?
Well I do...
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
...Huh?
I couldn't believe it either...
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
When you don't they're usually nice.
I said you're bad.
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
Uh-huh.
Sign.
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
It's not strictly legal.
For the money.
Ya catch any fish?
Got something to show me first?
Has Ray come in yet?
How would I know?
Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Tuesday night is ladies' night. All your drinks are free.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Anything you can tell me?
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Only you. and the photo lab.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Jeffrey nothing.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
No way.
Yes.
No. please. I won't.
No.
Don't say that.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
Falling.
I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.
I sure don't hate you.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
I asked first.
Yes.
It's okay. it's okay.
Okay Frank.
Good, let's drink up.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
How is Central these days?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
That sounds good.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
What did you see?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
I'm really sorry.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
No.
Sandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
No Jeffrey!!
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Jeffrey. honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do. it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
Yeah, I know.
Anyone else?. Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Oh, I see.  George.  Well, that explains everything.  Open your mouth, George.
What?
That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
Derek!
What is?
You happy, baby?
We'll take it.
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
It's garbage.
It's garbage.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For everyone.  For you, and you, and you.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.
I heard.
I don't want to talk about it.
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
I would if I could get some sleep.
No, my brother.
George, are we gonna do this or not?
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
Try the back bedroom.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
Beautiful girls?
Diego?
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
That was a beautiful message.
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
What about him?
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail.  We're getting middled.
Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer the question.  What do I spend?  What? How will we live?
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
Yeah, you will.  Of course.
I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.
Do what you want, it's a free country.
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
Swear on my life.
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
Very nice.  I'll take it.
Stoned?
Yeah?
Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
Who speaks Spanish?
Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
The strike is a success; but ...
Second district ... Explain better ...
They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
I don't do that kind of thing.
Here?
Yes, I think so too ... It's been organized well ... But what will the French do?
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.
So -- where do we start?
You got something on the Coke?
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
How?
Not sure.  I'll have everything you need tomorrow.
But there's more?
A massive cardiac arrest.
No.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
No -- never.
The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
No -- but I can get it for you.
Thank you.
Yeah.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.
Intense.
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
What kind of condition are you referring to?
What happened after that?
Oriental medicine.
Why does she come to you?
Chinese peony root.
A previous witness stated that she saw Miss Lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on October twenty-eighth.  According to your records when did you prescribe the drug?
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
Yes.  I suppose it's possible.
That bastard!
You've tried it?  Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Yes.
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
Yes.
There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur.  Did you kill him?
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
You still haven't answered my question.
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
No -- it just doesn't look right.
I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
Honey.
I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
You better.  Please answer the question.
He could let you have your vacation.
What time did you leave?
We were here two Christmases ago.
I simply can not stand that tone!
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Well, I can help.
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose.  But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
I'd laugh first then I'd kill them. Make sure they heard me laughing.
She used to be so friendly.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
Must be nice having kids.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
We got engaged.
Why did you stop?
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
Francesca?
We're not doing anything wrong, do you.
I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
No.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
I understand.  That's very kind of you.
Oh, how is he?
What?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
I bet you could do a book.
Uh-huh. And?
You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
No.
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
What makes it different, Robert?
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
Nah.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
They're not going to find her!
Apparently just before her death.
WHAT!
Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains and that's a fack.  Hey-heh...
Just try it.
I said, no thanks.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
What?
Where we'll always be...
You always told me, it's a dog eat dog world.
You mean as opposed to your life?
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
Dead?  I don't think your past is dead.  It's alive.  And it bites.
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
Don't call me that.
What building?
Last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job.
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
You're pretty black to be growing up in Rossmore Park.
But the place burned to the ground.
Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.
No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
Two point one seventy-six.
Open the case!
What are you talking about?
You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You understand?
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
No!
I can't.  I can't.
What the fuck is going on?
Jesus, Caesar!
Why?  'Cause you know him?
They just left, didn't they?
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
All right, Caesar.
No.
You don't, you can't believe that ...
I don't know.  We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Don't try to tell me what to do.
Shut up, Violet.
Everything you couldn't.
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
Lick me.
I could be lying.
What?  They ain't there?
Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, I'd probably do the same thing.
Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they.
Oh yeah.  Violet!
I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?
A favor?
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
Yeah.
He said you lost something.
Yeah, come on in.
Sure.
Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
Almost five years.
Because it's the truth.
How much money?
Yeah.
Who is Gino?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
What did Gino drink?
Shit!  Oh shit!
Trust me, Violet.
The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch.  Trust.
Not Caesar.
okay, all right.
I'm still here.
I was so afraid you ...
Caesar wants me to stay.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
Turn?  To who?  Where does he turn? What does he have to offer?  He's got nothing.  He's a killer.  He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?
-- if we can get a clean shot --
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
Yes.
Why?
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
We have to go home, Jason.
Jason Bourne is dead.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
I have some very bad news for you, sir.  I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
Thanks.
Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it?  Cutthroat.
Oh, Jesus... 
I know that.

Nothing.  It's just not there.
No.  No.  Go around.  Keep going...
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
I don't remember any of this.
Thanks for the ride.
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
He came to kill us.
You knew he was coming.
No.
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
Who paid the bill?
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
We have to keep moving.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
I can't protect you anymore.
So get the hell out of here.
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
What have you done to my flat?
Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
What? You mean you've got ...
You must save the day.
Layton.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
Your father and I were very close. Of course Jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing  and I  keep his name alive at the office every day.
SAM! What a surprise!
Are you officer 412/L?
Not much.
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
Shut up! This is a professional relationship!
Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
Please!
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
What?
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
They couldn't be worse for the Buttles.
Well, all wars do -
Well, terrorists of course.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Please, Jill ... I love you.
Go away.
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
Where are you going?
Information Retrieval.
Would you really, Sam?
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Try next of kin.
What?
You are good to me Sam.
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
Sam Lowry.
How long will she he away?
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams.
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
Not now ... please
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
Um ...
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have?
Thank you for calling Cen -
I don't know which numero.
What is it?
It's a 27B/6, what did you think it was?
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
Time to go.
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
She's having a baby. Twins.
Stressed? He's psycho.
Sleeping in the back.
She asked me to pick her up.
That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
Just take it easy.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
No. He's dead.
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
Sure, sure, give go.
He's dead, huh?
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
I think it looks good.
How is she?
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
Sure.
Don't seem so bad to me.
No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
The ghosts--
I think the worst is over.
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
God help us, he's hungry too.
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You okay?
I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.
Why?
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
Turn here. You missed it. The Chink is on 3rd.
Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait, I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go, hurry up. Come on.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
You write this?
Nice, Jane.
Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
No?
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
London.
Are you any closer to a decision?
Sure.
Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
Did you bring your grey suit?
As good as humanly possible.
Yes.
Then what was good about it?
I'm not kidding.
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
No.  You know that I'm not.
I just found out.  You didn't say anything to me?  You just resign? Will you meet me now? -- No, now! I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.
Yes.
In other times, with other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war.  But it was the civil war -- in Angola -- and he was in it for the money.
Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
I'll never tell.
No stop where he's all besieged.
What?
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
I agree with you -- you're not qualified.  So get qualified.  You can insist on being better prepared.  You don't have to just leave it as...  'I don't write.  I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'
We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Billion.
Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.
I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
I'll get you through.  Move and smile.  And smile and move...
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Oh, good.
We can go together.
Because you're nuts.
Where are you?
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
I know.  I taped it.
What?
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you?  You're more adorable than your pictures.  Look what I got for you.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
Right back to you.
I just might.
I'm going home!
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
Are you a virgin?
Anything new?
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
Carla...
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
All about me...
I know.  But I wanted to talk to you.
Of course I do!
That means you like me!
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Just about anything, Walter.
There's...a body inside that statue!
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
I'm totally serious!
Why don't you cover it up, Walter!
I know, man.
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
Well I was uh, just looking...
Well I don't know -
They are?
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
Oh, yeah.  It can get real expensive.
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
Relax!
Walter shut up and relax!
What do you get?
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
Really?
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
What's the matter with you!
Shut up!  You let him have it!
Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.
Which way did she go?
Eeyuu.
Uum... around ten?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
Come on, what was it?
Jealous?
'Bye.
Didn't you get my message?
I think you've forgotten something.
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
Thanks.
Who?
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
Get away from me!
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
Like what?
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
Am I in trouble or something?
My birthright?  You mean, like a trust fund?
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
Wait!
Time to do what?
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
All right.
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
Sporting events, yeah.
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
Oh.  Good.
I had to test you.
I don't think you understand the full implications of --
You are such a wet.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
Yeah... She's okay, though.
You're having a fling with him?
Later for it.
Could be.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
Wit-tay.
Well, look who's here.
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
I don't think so.
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
There are two important psychic conduits called the "pingala" and the "ida".  The pingala starts with the left testicle  and ends at the right nostril.
I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"--
Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right?
I'll tuck you in.
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
So...Wanta make love?
That's my job too.
You're pulling your hips out.
No.  Please.
Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around--  Great deal.  You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing-  So what do you really want?  You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic?  Or do you want a guy?
I want you desperately!
And now you wanta teach me?
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
Yeah...you a witch?
Three-fourteen?  Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson
You got a live arm there.
You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
How?
Gimme that.
I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
C ' mon!
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
God damn it, you fucking virgin prick--step outside.
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
No.
The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
You can do anything you want.  Hop in.
We're eight and sixteen.
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
Well, I'd rather not say.
Don't tell him I told you--he'd break my neck.
Now, instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky, they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky...
He's lying.
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
I can't do that.
Excuse me.
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Wait, hold on a second.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
702 472 1862.
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
I can't! I'm tied!
Oh, no, please, please.
Matter of fact...
How did Nicky collect?
To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
In other words, I'm fucked.
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
No, I don't wanna come -
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody.
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
What are you -
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!
Yeah, uh, who's this?
She's there with you?  She's there with you?
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
All right, we're clear.
Why is she eight pounds over?
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
Who's this?
Thank you.
But mostly...
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
Understand?  I'm sorry.
Yeah.
I'm not crying. 
What are you talkin' a- ?
Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?
Okay, okay.
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?
Yeah.
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
You're not takin' Amy.
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
You fuckin' whore!
So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
I am calm!
If she calms down...
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
Mm.
Yeah?
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
Yes.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
I'll to the FBI!
And here. Here.
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Tell him to go fuck himself? You fuckin' hick!  Fuckin'...
Is that the last one?
Yeah. Fuck him.
He's gone?
Calm down! Calm down!
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
But I'm just trying to leave.
Fine, fine.
What're you gonna do?
Are you sure?
Okay.  Frankie, you're a good boy.
And how are things going down there?
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
I know what you mean.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
What? What?
You know?
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Yes, you are.
Is that what you want?
Yeah.
What about my money?
All right. Be careful.
Okay, yeah.
Well, you know...
Thank you. Very nice.
You are.
Okay, then.
We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.  You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?
He was just on the phone.
You're driving me nuts!
Yes, don't worry.
Hold it, hold it. Here.
Get up.
Get up.
Pleasure.
Remo.
But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
It's up to you.
They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready.
So are we.
Let's get out of here.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
Yeah, what's to stop him?
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
This motherfucker, do you believe this? Two fuckin' days and nights!  Fuck me?
Hey.
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
I don't know. I can't remember.
What did you think?
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
I suppose she does.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
Why am I still troubled...
Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
You are...
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
Maybe.
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
How was I in the wrong?
Theo wants to talk again.
You gotta just look the other way.
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
Or relieve me of it later.
There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
Will you let me explain!
Don't lay this on me!
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Who?
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Please.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
They don't know you.  They won't listen.
I'm not looking to get myself killed.  I just hope the battery on this phone holds out.
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
And that was the end of it?
Well you did.
That makes two of us.
What bank?
If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  Tufts, you know.  It still hasn't grown fully in.  The other one is from the islands.  Braided hair -- very dark.
You can't give up.
Did you hear that click?
What did you do?
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
She'll never be the same.  None of us will.
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
There isn't any such person.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
Do you have to point that?
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
You're enjoying this too much.
You could've hit me.
Why are we stopping?
I need a break.  I've been on a marathon run ever since I had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
-- The phones, Theo.  Don't leave any of them behind.  The cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you.
Twenty percent.
What time frame have you got in mind?
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
Got a phone in that van?
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
And then?
Sure, I end up with some cash. And a lot of bonds I don't know how to dispose of.
It's in your interest, Nels, since the additional passenger in my trunk -- an LAPD officer is probably carrying a few bullets in him traceable to the piece you're carrying.  Tell the man.
Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends.  Tighten your belts.  Here it comes.  Ready?
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
Nobody can do anything right but you!
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
He's what she should run a mile from.
Nice.
Jimmy.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Fuck off back to Essex!
Fucking mad!
No.
Like treacle.
Yes, thank you.
The one you gave me in the Metro.
Do I?
No, depends on nothing.
Where?
Sorry, darling.
Must be.
So I'm sorry.
All right, they do.
Please, Jimmy.
Don't be cruel.
Not at all, honey.
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
And you're not going to tell me more?
I can't.
Afraid so.
No. Sit down.
It's a secret.
For me.
Look on it like a honeymoon.
I was trying to get out of something.
You mean that?
Yeah.
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
Can't remember...
Don't call me that --
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
Can't.
Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart.
My pleasure.
Eddie and Tinker died.
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
So you did fuck up.
Of course. I forgot.
And what happens then?
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
I sincerely hope so.
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Yes.
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
Aye, I do, Peter.
It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh? He visits his ladies on Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday mornings. His security's in the car beyond.
Kind of suicide, isn't it?
Can't.
No fucking way.
What the fuck do you know about my people?
What the fuck were you doing here?
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
The fastest.
Don't be so sure.
Doesn't matter where.
Like what?
My special friend.
It's as simple as that?
What?
I told you not to talk that way --
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
Who gives a fuck.
You shut your face --
No, we are.
Give me the fucking shooter!
 I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you. 
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
Let's look anyway.
It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
You lied to me so many times --
All right, prove it to me -- tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps.
I heard you, I heard you.
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
And I'm afraid we want it back.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Were you followed?
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
Carson?
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
Me? Why me?
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
Very good.
Bartholomew?
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Then who does?
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Sure.
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Why can't you be serious?
What are you doing?
Cutting it out.
Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.
I'll be right there.
It's a start, anyway.
Why don't you shut up!
Are you going to listen?
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
How much is it worth?
No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
He was a wealthy man?
I don't know.
One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
And this? And this?
Okay.
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!
Up there! I would put it up there!
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
We'll find you a hotel.
I don't think I follow you.
What your husband was mixed up in.
Where?
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
Va jouer, mon ange.
Because I don't love him.
I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
He's allergic to him.
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
I'm glad. But what's all this?
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
We will separate -- you look over there.
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
Yeah? What's that?
Who invited you?
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
Not my imports.
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight.
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
I will. Is that all?
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
You know where I can find her?
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?

I'm sure you should have failed.
I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
Sure.
Then you should go.
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
I can't right now.
Don't you think it's sick?
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
Pretend we're just another couple.
Did he say anything else about her?
Don't make me order you.
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Hide your laptop here.
You can't bring it.
Told you to hide it.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
Okay, okay.
EXT. ROAD - DAY.
...that is going to explode...
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.
Since when does...
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
Andy.  Another fuckin'...
Oh.
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
That dog was mean before I met him.
Shut...
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
...-er.
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
You stole this truck.
Shut up.
What?
...-ed.
Oh...
Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
You wanna hit me?
Oh, shit.
  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
I don't think we have much of a choice...
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
God, man!

Come on.
I know the likeli-...
...Night Shift, but you might...

...ho!


Okay.
Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
What?

Whoo-hoo-hoo!
What?

Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
...stole the truck.
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
...hospital.
We got two paddles.
...shit.
 Whoo!
You all right?
They're movin'.
We're gonna die!
 Come on!
Okay. 
Okay. 


 That's why I didn't give it...

Okay.
  I've got the real thing!
We've got Elvis!

Whoo!
You've gotta be...
 
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sorry.
They'll meet you at the top.


You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.

Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
Oh, oh!
Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're worried...
...without compunction.
 Look, I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you.  Whatever you want.  Please!
Sure as hell have met a few assholes like that, though.
He's the dude...
Hold it!
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
And I changed the schedule.
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
Good to see you again, Leo.
And I don't like deviations from plans, Leo, as I'm sure you re-...
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...

They took that life away and left me with nothing.

The print's pretty fine. I forgot my glasses. I'd like to be able to read across.
Who's the investigating officer?
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
His girlfriend?
Yeah.
No.
I didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other.
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
What are you talking about?
In the garage.
Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too.
Sue the shit out of 'em.
Or her name?
Let me show you something.
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
C'mon I'll show you.
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
What are you having?
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
I don't want to drop it.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
A check?
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
It wasn't much of a lie.
I was grateful.
That your maiden name?
No reason.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Then it was over the water department.
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
No.
Get in the car.
Your eye.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
The police?
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
You're insane.
Sure.
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
...so that's why you hate him...
With us.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Yes...
Yes?
When it comes.
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
Mr. Gittes...
I'm afraid so.
Then go home and forget about it.
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
May I ask what this is regarding?
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Neither do I.
But that's what you told your wife.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
So I can have these? 
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
Come in, Alfredo.
Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things...  That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before...  And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it...  And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?
That's right, Modern Times.
No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! Life's not like you saw it in the movies. Life...is harder.  Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're young, the world is yours! And I'm old...I don't want to hear you talk any more, I want to hear talk about you.
But...who...
The son of one of his colleagues. Don't act that way. We'll talk about it later. Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with the five o'clock bus.
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
I told him I'd take his advice. But before I went away I left you that note...  I was on my way down the stairs... 
You shouldn't tell me that now. After all these years!  I put all your things in here. Go in, go in...
OK...
The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
Oh!
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
You don't really think so?
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
That's right.  They called us the "Three Musketeers."
Enthusiastic?
Sure, sure.
Probably.  There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it.
I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
Ask them to sit down.
That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
We've got a nice plant here.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, but I wonder if - 
Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
In the water.
I'll get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing I do.
No.  But you're close.
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
Well, I -
That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
At night?
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Susan, I really think -
I'm going to leave you.
You can't stop me.
Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one.  I don't even know what a gentleman is.  You see, my idea of a gentleman, Mrs. Kane - well, if I owned a newspaper and if I didn't like the way somebody else was doing things - some politican, say - I'd fight them with everything I had.  Only I wouldn't show him in a convict suit, with stripes - so his children could see the picture in the paper.  Or his mother.  It's pretty clear - I'm not a gentleman.
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
You've made your point perfectly clear, Mr. Kane.  Good day.
The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you don't realize you're talking to two people.
On the other hand -  I am the publisher of the Enquirer. As such, it is my duty - I'll let you in on a little secret, it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent, hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money- mad pirates because, God help them, they have no one to look after their interests!  I'll let you in on another little secret, Mr. Thatcher.  I think I'm the man to do it.  You see, I have money and property -
Yes, sir. 
Do you know what that is?
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
I've got to think of Emily -
Go ahead.
She's going to leave you -
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday.  I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane. She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget.  With assurances of the highest esteem -
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
All we saw on that screen was a big American -
Get out of here!  Get out!  Get out!
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
Am I sure about what?
How long have you been smoking?
You think I'm shitting you...
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
I think you'd better leave now.
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
I take it she likes the guy.
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
Such a sordid state of affair.
I'll try to manage.
I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
Very dramatic, I thought.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
Look how full of yourself you are.
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
I left like an hour ago.
Do you always talk weird after you violate women?
Um... okay.
I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
Um... I don't know.  What time did hockey end?
We did.
With this guy locked in?
Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
Excuse me?
Yes.
Well, he missed!
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
What's your point?
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
Bunch of savages in this town.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
It takes different strokes to move the world.
What about Veronica?
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
Basically.
The quest isn't going well?
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
Why not?
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
What?
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
You know what pisses me off the most?
Sorry.
You've got a customer.
Exactly. They drank it all.
It's today.
She meant nothing to you!
An embolism in a pool.
That's embarrassing?
He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.
I swear.
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
I want to rent a movie.
Let me borrow your car.
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
Five hundred dollars.
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
This life.
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
Lovely story.
To talk to you.
It's not like I'm miles away.
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
I didn't strain. I sighed.
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
I don't know.
How do you know that?
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
You used to go out with her?
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
How flattering.
Something wrong?
I touched a nerve.
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
It better be up to and including me.
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
He gets off on it.
Like you said-she snowballed him.
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
Let it go...
Lower your voice!
Um. Thirty-seven.
A few?
...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
What is it?
Thank you for the lasagne.
It was only a few times...
Randal...?
Fuck you.
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
I think it's coming now...
A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
He's your cousin?
Check this out, he's from Russia.
I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
Feel that.
That's tight. Solid.
No, I wasn't.
I beg your pardon!
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
You're not?
He didn't ask me to...
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
Like hell you are!
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!
Exactly, cheesehead, exactly.
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
Rooster!  Forget the hen stuff. Be safe, honey.  Over.
Y'know, Jessie, doesn't Frank look like a normal guy--but he's not,  are you Frank?
A bad climb, no, just another challenge.  What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
I love you, too.
Look, I know--
Hey, about everything that happened with Sarah.  I know you did what you could--
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Just hangin' out.
Where've you been?
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
A lot of things fell apart up there.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
You couldn't.
Excuse me?
Flare up of old emotions...
Where?
And I can't leave.
He doesn't want my help.
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
How'd you get up here?
You know me, I'm a night person.
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
Making things real rough for Hal.
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
Take the rope.
RUN, DAMMIT!!
Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
Ask the questions.
I haven't even got on it yet.  Let's go, time to fetch.
What about it?
Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
What did you do that for?
You bastards... bastards.
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.
Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee.
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
Alexander de Large, sir.
Brown hair, is it?
Through there for a bath.
We're going to friends now, sir.
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
You've heard Beethoven before?
Fine. Fine.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Good. What do you want?
It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
Amen. They cross themselves.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
Thank you.
You got a deal.
No.  You were right, I was wrong...  ...Max.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
When was the last time you took one?
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
You still carrying passengers?
You're kidding me.
Jesus...
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
Sorry?
I think...
Twenty five?
Take him down.  Save Richard Yip, our witness...
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
Not our call, Phil.
Oh, call me Ida.  To what do we owe the pleasure?
Tell me about it.
Vincent...
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
Yo, whassup?
<u>My hands are taped to the fucking </u> <u>steering wheel!</u>
I was just tryin' to...to...
Hang on.  Carefully...
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four.
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
You on some kind of work plan?
Me, specifically?
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Like what?
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
I'll make it an even five hundred. Plus an extra hundred if you get me to LAX on time.
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
I think so.
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Who was he?
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Because I have a gun and I say so.
It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
Collateral damage.
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
That's the point.  You play <u>between</u> the notes, you dance <u>around</u> the structure, you improvise.  Some people know where they're going to be ten years from now.  Same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over.  That's not living.  That's dying a little every day.  Not me, pal.  It's not knowing what's around the corner that makes like worth living.  That's jazz.  That guy up there, he knows what I'm talking about.  Hell, it's the same thing <u>he's</u> talking about, if you just open your ears.  You can hear it in the conversation he's having with that trumpet...
You mind?  I'm working here.
Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
It's not bullshit.
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off.  Quit stalling and get out of the cab.
Who?
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
It's what I do for a living.
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
That's what you said...
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
...indifferent.
...pie in the sky?  "Someday my dream'll come..."  But one night you'll wake up and realize suddenly you're old.  It hasn't happened.  It never will.  Life just flipped on you.  Tomorrow became yesterday.  Then you'll bullshit yourself it was never gonna happen, anyway, and push it back in memory...and anesthetize yourself in a Barcalounger with daytime TV for the rest of your life...  Don't talk to me about murder.  You're <u>do-in</u>' yourself...in this yellow prison with steel-belted radials. Clocking in and out everyday...
I should have done that.  Fixed it and more.  Get out from under what I been under...
Slow down!
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview.
Yeah.
Yeah.  I think so.
What newsletter?
Flesh wound.  No big deal.
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Can you prove any of this?
Who are you, Jerry?
Please put it down.
What van?
Realized what?
Cold War's over, Jerry.
You will?
If that's what you want.  Yes.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
Did you kill him?
Because he believed me.
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
Now she tells me.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
That's your option.  Ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time.  In case you didn't know it, you're crazy.
It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
<u>Why you</u>?
Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
Then this is a goddamn emergency.
What the hell does that mean?
Wasn't my idea.
What do you mean?
He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
Ellie?
What?
There is no abort procedure -- we don't know how we turned the damn thing on, let alone how to turn it off.
He died...  ... in 1972.
Dr. Arroway, do you think it's possible you had some kind of... delusional episode.
Tell me.
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
What?
... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
A third layer.
VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old.
1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear it's nice too.
You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
And a hundred mile airspace.
I don't have an official response, Michael.  All I have are the same questions you have.
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
Can you help us?
The librarian... or the library...?
You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
So.  What happens now?
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
None taken... but ... do we get to come back?  Others of my kind, I mean.
No more stalling, Captain.
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
-- even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission.  Heaven is the mustard seed.
That's my girl.  Done.
Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we feasted on her.  And now that we've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap... we're pulling out.  That's Paris, where my daughter was born.  Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking.  So many battles, so many lives... all that sturm, and drang.  As if it never happened.  If it weren't for a few power grids, you wouldn't know we existed.
The systems integration site.
We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
The V.L.A.?
It's really happening.
Wait -- hold on a minute --
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
Do you love your parents?
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
Prove it.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Something like that.
I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
What is it?
I can't do this --
What are you so afraid of?
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
I'll make it a dollar.
Smokin' it up here, Boss.
That's good: he earned it.
I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
-- went down to see this old hag and she had needles the size of that cane.
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
'Bout two hours left.
He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
Well, whatta we got here?
That's what you're gonna have to do.
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
Take it easy, Drag.
On my own.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
Hal has it.
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
Where is it?
She don't want it.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here.
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
Then what do you need me for?
Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  I'll drive you down...
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
Okay.
Who came in after you?
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
Who gives a fuck?  In all the years I never seen you cry.  You loved him.
We could use a little help.
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
Well, yes.  You're getting out of bed tomorrow. They want you to walk.
After being bombarded endlessly by road- safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in-an actual accident.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
Have you seen his penis?
I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive?
One of my suitors.
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
Can I give you a lift?  I somehow find myself driving again.
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
I work in the immigration department there.
Isn't that rather too close...?
I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
I can drive.
You're not jealous, are you? You have to understand... Helen and I had this strange, intense... experience together.
Patient.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
Maybe if we had them both to dinner or something.
Yeah, it'll be fun.
No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate.
I ruined your wedding night.
Come on.
You've only known Jake a few months.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
Just remember that I love him.
Mottled really.   Green and red.
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
I've already checked it out 17 times.
Paul.
Good God.
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
That's where I always go when I get out.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
All over.  Did you see your new apartment?
I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
It's sex time.
No.
Thanks.
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
Coming.
I got worried. Are you OK?
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
Well then why'd it happen?
I know I don't want to lose you.     I don't think I could stand it.
How about something better?   Like a kiss.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
Yeah.
No.
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
He's a patient here.
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
I'm glad you're doing well.
Office work?
Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.
Do you know who this is?
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
Where did they go?
Oui.
C'mon, Laurant, America?
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
No thank you.
I'm good.   Really.
-- Super what?
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
No problem.
No one? Then why is Zero here?
You didn't buy batteries?
I can't believe you didn't check.
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
You better.
What'd they take?
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
And the other car?
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
You can use my car.
That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
Mr. Taylor?
No, that's not Mr. Taylor.
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
Yeah, I dig him.
Feel free to correct him if you want.
Oh, you think?
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
And you don't speak French?
-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
You wanna tell him?
It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
After last night I could say the same for you.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
I'll never live as a thief!
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
So what if I don't?
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
How so?
I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Jen!
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
My comb!
You coward!
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
I knew she would intrigue you.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.
Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
A murderer?
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
Care for a hot dog?
No onions?
Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
We'll discuss this later. Obviously.  You left the door open.
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
It's yesterday!  Do you know what you destroyed?
Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
Shelly?
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Very well, it's your ass.
No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.
To be sure.  Now tell how your friend died.
I'm sure you're going to love it there.
Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine.
You didn't show it to anybody?
On my mother's life.
Oh really?
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
I sincerely doubt it.
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Why not?
Give it up.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
I'm... I'm alright.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
Need any company?
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa.
What?
"I actually feel good about myself?"
I can't win with you.
No?
Not at all. Have a seat.
Why are you doing this?
Because I'm in love with you.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
I think that's for the best.
Why aren't you understanding?
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
Ben Schwarz.
What do you mean?
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
Absolutely.
Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Do you want to learn or not?
It was nothing.
I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
Good night Cecile.
I know.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
I'll be in touch.
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
Loser.
Okay.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
I hate it too.
What's your problem?
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.
Tell me all the details.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
No, I'm not.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
Thank you. Now, where were we?
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
I think you have your answer.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
She's out.
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
Yes, you already did.
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
Don't worry about it.
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
Once the emptiness in Amy's life is filled, the dream will go of itself. If a up to you, both of you. Only you two can bring her into a real world.. You must give her the friendship and love she craves.
Did you ever make a wish?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
I got my wish anyway.
You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
That's the Farren house.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
I'll show you.
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
I have eyes too, and I tell you no one's there. If you deny that, if you insist that this woman you call your friend is in the garden, then I'm afraid I shall have to punish you. Do you understand?
Yes, darling.
You called me by my name.
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
Of course,
But we don't have any sea weed.
My dolls. We can pretend.
Oh, thank you, Amy.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong — warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
It's a pretty ring.
Let me take another look at that ring.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
Go on -- out with you.
Don't apologize. It's great to see a woman really enjoying her food. I hate it when I buy a woman dinner and she won't even touch it.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
At Victoria's Secret.
I mean where on your body?
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
So don't look in his eyes.
Maybe he's just shy.
Only to see.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
Frida, grab that red one.
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
Did I kill him? Of course not!
No. I don't think so.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not judging you... You didn't sleep with the creep did you?
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
I looked like an Italian man!
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
He's been here all night?
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
Ignore it.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
Check out what I found.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
I guess you'll find out.
I wish I only had your problems.
Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
They say sex is great for cramps.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
This really isn't a good time.
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
Oh, it's nothing.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
Yeah. Maybe.
I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today.
A man killed in Central Park.
No, I got it. It's okay.
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
Worse than this?
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
You use the word "fucking." You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex.
How big?
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days.
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
And you think I'm sick?
You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
And fifth, you're dating her.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
And that was 28 days ago today.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Just visiting my patient.
Yes.  This way.
Sheís getting better, thanks.  She...
Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
What is going on?
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
That's what people keep telling me.
You can't go yet.  We've got so much to talk about...
Not that again...
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
For a month.
Well it's a last minute change.
I don't give a shit.
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
Three years.
Oh.  Fine.
What I told him to?
Bob...
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
I'll lock him away for good.
This is undeclared income.
And who's gonna find out?
That'd be great.
In the car?
What?
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
And it's proving quite effective...
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
And these are a gift from the King of To go.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
What?
My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two thousand dollar budget.
No.
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
Oh... right...  You know, ever since the stroke...
Uh...
They asked me to help.
I know.
But you could go to jail for it.
I know. I'm sorry...
That's okay.
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.
Quiet!
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They could sting, sister. We know you came up against 'em. We been watchin' you since you landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could....well, it could be the end of everything.
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
Maybe.
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
What?
Come on!
The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.
God....damn you, Rhodes!
No wonder they're so....hungry.
Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
Sir!
I'm alright. Let's go.
Will do.
They're townies?!
Hell no, I'm not afraid of them just, if we get caught with them, we're dead.
Women swoon!
Meeks, you're the brain here.  What do the dead poets say about somebody like me?
Yep.
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
This is it.
I'm not?
Your family move into that new house, Mr. Overstreet?
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
It's Nuwanda.
Sort of.
You going out for the Henley Hall play?  They're doing "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
You are?  She's glad I called!
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Are you going with Chet?
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
Uh-huh.
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
My Word
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
Very good, Mr._?
Meeks.
"We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." Anybody want to read?
Courtyard?
Yawp!
Again!  Louder!
I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
Nothing wrong with research.
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak.
Screw it all.  I don't give a damn about any of it.
Good luck.
Father, I--
The god of the cave.
A play, dummy.
Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
Quiet.  I have to think.
I will be with thee straight.
Yes, and acting!  It's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. Most people, if they're lucky, live about half an exciting life! If I could get the parts, I could live dozens of lives.
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
He's the owner...
I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here!
I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
And no questions asked.
Dead.
Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
It ain't any better out there!
I saved your life is what I did!
What are those things?
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
Yeah you did...
How do you know that?
What?
...the minute you start your engines ...it's goint to kill us, isn't it?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
I'm flying blind here God damn it!
And you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening.
How does an island sound to you?
Joey...
I'm looking...
I know...
Damn right!
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
We're all going.
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
Hey! Fuckin' A!
I'll get it! Where is it?
You're full of shit!
They did not!
So he's in the next one, Albert. I mean take it easy. I mean you're driving everybody nuts!
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
Here. Hit it here.
Married?
What hospital is he in? Where?
No.
But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
You are his friend.
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
You mean...?
I show you. Come. You come.  Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right?
Not bad fresh, but they don't keep worth a pig's fart.
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
No?
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
Sal's alive???
Linda... Hey, Linda...
What?
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
Right here.
What?
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
From Nam?
Pow.
From Nam?
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
I thought you might be praying.
I'm doing that too.
You gotta learn, Vince! You come out here... You got no jacket, you got no pants, you got no knife and you got no boots. You think everyone's gonna take care of you! That's what you always think, but this time you're wrong. This time you're on your own!
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
The fuck I did!!!
Up.
Down ribbon!
I'd think about it.
Put that on your political resume.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
You sure?  I can help you.
Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
Pass.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
Drop it.
I was set up.
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
You're not pregnant, are you?
How do I look?
I'm signing off.
You could always take it off.
Of course I will.
They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
That's my problem, Belle.
All right, Daniel. Jump in.
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Why? It don't hurt.
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
No, you're not.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
I don't care.
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
Just a minute, neighbor Stone. I promised you money and all that money can buy. I don't recall any other obligations. But let's look at the contract.
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
Yes -- at midnight.
Morning, Jabez.
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants!
Yep.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
We can still use my butter money.
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Jabez!
Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn.
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
I don't know, Jabez.
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?
Mary!
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
You'll be a father any minute now.
Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee --
Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
I object.
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
I can't be honest with them.
That's okay.  This is my first time riding in one.
It's okay, it's okay.
Not any more.
Ellis, what have you told them?
The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you.
He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
Yeah.  I remember our first date.
I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
I'm here, cowboy.
I still feel like shit.
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
How do you know?
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
Come on, what's under this?
Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now.
You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
What about the kids?
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
You know, Sonny, I used to dope a lot, and I was into dipping?  And I did a couple bank jobs, and the Lord Jesus in his everlasting mercy saved me, you know how?
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Well.... huh ...
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
What are you talking about?
What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
I don't know what I'm doing.
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
What are you doin' in there?
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
I'll see what they'll do.
Sonny, come on out!
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
What else?
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Believe me, I'm on your side.
Well, they go to guard school.
Are you a lawyer?
You were terrific, too!
Did you always call him Junior.
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
What are you crying for?  Jesus Christ.  It's not your fault there's no money...
How'd that happen?
I want him to think that.

Does that still go?
I never been up in a plane before.
Get over there!
Okay, Sonny.
I want them all.
I have to see.
You can't allow!  I'm running this thing, what gives you the idea you can say shit?  Come on.  I'll pay you.  Whatta you want?  Two hundred?  A thousand?
I forgot she's in here.
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?
You could give up.

No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
Gotta go.
That's it.
Ten.
My name is Eddie.
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
I'm in here.
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Sal's gonna be mad.
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
What responsibilities?
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
Innocent!

D, not C.
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
Look at that.
Do I have to spell it out?
Can ya dig it?
It's a motherfucking shame.
ML, hold this for me.
Be off in a second.  Tina, I dedicated a record on Mister Señor Love Daddy's show to you.
Tonight, when we close.
Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
Where we goin'?
I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.
Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.
Mookie?
OK.  OK.
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
Later for you.

I don't know.
I don't like to fight.
I was going to buy a slice.
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
Here, take the broom.  The front needs sweeping.
Then we could try something else.
We don't know nuthin' else.
I'm sick of niggers, it's a bad neighborhood.  I don't like being around them, they're animals.
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
Gotcha.
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
I'm just not ready.
So boys, how was your first day?
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
I haven't seen you around here before.
No no no no no.
Why not?
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
...cause you said...
Alright, if you really want to go down this road, well girl's like chocolate.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Captain Rob came back?
D2.
That must be her boyfriend's car.
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
Roger that, Wilco.
And with that complete loser
Try one in a million!
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
So can I come along?
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
You were born free and free you should remain.
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
Okay.
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
Hey can be on top?
You know I do!
Will that be on the midterm?
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
And I you.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
Yes!
And, take some more pictures.
And you are great in bed.
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
The evidence of what?
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
Not sorry enough.
The Emperor's blade.
It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
I'm ready.
Yes...
You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us....  We welcome you.
It burns.
I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
SILENCE!
I'd know the difference.
The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!
We have our new army.  Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character!  Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  <u>I need transvestites</u>!
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
That's good.  I could use the money.
I gotta type this up, while it's still fresh!
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
Correct.  So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
Formaldehyde.
Soon, Bela... Soon.
Has anyone ever been to Downey?
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
No problem.  I know it by heart...
I don't know.  Where?
Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
These shoes are itchy.
Edward Wood, Sir.
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
What?
Better than not getting a job?
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Toss us out on our ass.
Exactly.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
I'm going to my mother's.
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
Oh!  Our church has the money for one film.  We just don't have it for all twelve...
<u>Lugosi</u>??!  Didn't be pass on?
I like.  When do movie shoot?
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
So you're not gonna make the movie?
No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie!  I've already preósold Alabama and Oklahoma.  Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff.  So we'll just make it without that she-male.  We'll fictitionalize it.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
Hmm.  There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications."
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Why not??
They're very nice.  Let me get my coat.
A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live.  I thought he was much scarier in person.
Huh?
Bela died.
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
Yes?
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
It's the same film.  But the distributor wanted a punchier title. C'mon!  It's gonna be a big event -- we're going all out!  Bela, Tor, and Cris are coming.  You'll have fun!
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
Exactly.  Hey, how 'bout this -- what if I don't have any lines?  I'll do the part mute!
Nah, it'll work.  Where's Bela?
You know, to make the legs move --
Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
Who?
I guess -- I don't -- it's all in the contract. There's this million-page contract --
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
Who?
What?
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
What if Shari's the dream?
Good luck.
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
Oh my God!
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
The doctor said you were having sex.
But Al is your husband now!
Ma...
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
She left.
What are you talking about?
She wouldn't tell me.
All right. Let them decide.
They're gonna mock our foibles.
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
Never would be plenty.
Well, then I'm quitting.
Who's in it?
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
Oh... how come?
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
Yeah, well...
Really? 
So?
Come on...
I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents.
Show business.
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
Hi, Shari.
Hi.
Thanks... That's ...
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
No.
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
What does that have to do with... ?
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
What kind of person?
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Dick... Dick,..
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
I know.
Ethics are...
Right
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Yeah.
That sounds good.
Yes?
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
What is it. Tammy?
Still clear?
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell?
No, wait -- apples.  Apples.
For what?
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Sure, Tracy.
So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
What's it to you?
Yeah, plain scotch.
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
Call me Dudley.
Yeah, I hate them.
Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn?
How?
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
What are you talking about?
Maybe.  I don't know.
Officer White, put down that weapon and --
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl. I'm investigating.
Against your code?
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
That's right.
I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous?  I can't think of anything.
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
Yeah, so...
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
Just show me where they are!
I never truck with no sissies!
Believed what?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And smart.
<u>Shit</u>.  Someone beat us here.
What?
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
What?
So what's the point?
I want to do it right.
Bud White's been here?
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
You sound like you mean it.
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
Do you have any proof?
What's Dudley's scheme?
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
All he found were rodents.  No signs of foul play.  So there.
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
I like it!  I like it!
Give me some Narco skinny.  I want to put out an all hop-head issue. Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.  Maybe tie it into the Rosenbergs.  You like?
This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
<u>They</u> said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
Listen--
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
I'll come straight there.
Why?
Yes.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
Wait.
They're spooks.
No shit.
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
I mean did you call anyone.
I called from a payphone!
I was a traffic analyst.
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
Jesus.
Why'd you leave?
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
The NSA killed him.
<u>Here</u>?!
Oh my God...
Tell me about it.
No.
I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
Is Jerry Delsano in?
My name's Neil. Maybe I can help you.
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
Neil, thank you for your help.
Yes. I have her permission.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
Can you help me?
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
I'm not his attorney.
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
You should take this seriously.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
How could you let me find out like this?
I've seen it.
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
Stacy--
Was that doctored-up, too?
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
Sir?
Never.
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
You're not.
That's temporary.
I'm gonna fix it.
How?
Fuck you. You may have to what?
Gimme the shoe.
I don't under--
Hi, dad.
Are those my Christmas presents?
Where's mom?
Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.
What about jewelry?
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
Rachel's dead?
So do I!
Turn yourself in.
It's been a few years.
Yeah.
What about the tapes?
Help from whom?  Christ.
He's clever. He had help.
Lyle?!
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Yes sir.
What kind of fossils?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
Which stall?
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Look over there.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
No, but I think I do.
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
What do you hate most?
Arabic?
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
Shall we be all right?
Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.
What?
Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
What did you do?
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility…
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis.  So if you need it…hard to know how long one's talking about.  We might all be back in a month or two.
There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.
I don't know.
Don't cut me.
Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
You were in Africa?
I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
So you can shoot a pistol?
Where've you been?
I think that's called looting.
For?
Is there a song you don't know?
What?
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
Apprentices.
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
Thank you.
Because I'm a nurse.
He's Canadian.
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
Kip's another one.
Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
Hey! -
Is something funny?
You get Hardy.
We can do that when we're very, very old.
A bit of one.
Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.
Through a window.
The windows don't open.
Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
You got a better idea?
Why didn't I think of that?
I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.
We're getting close.
Don't overestimate yourself.
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
I can't?
That's good. Terrific.
Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
Well, no...but...
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
Oh?
Maybe I should drive this time.
That's my girl.
It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
Look on the back. What do you see?
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
We go underwater?
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
True enough.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
Charged?
Get the hell in.
You don't know the half of it.
Okay, 80-20--
Hold the record. Alone.
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
Transfer.
It's no good without the argon gas.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
But that's all behind us now.
Have really held you under?
I'm sorry.
A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.
FUCKING THING!!!
No way.
You gave them the eight billion.
Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
That's because we live in the future. Which is what's on my mind.
I figured that out.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
Probably not.
That's a joke, right?
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
Who?
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
How does someone get meningitis?
Cause of the chromium.
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
If you hadn't used profanity --
You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
Course I did.
Lemme see it, will you?
-- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it.
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something.
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.
What?  Who?
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
Is that what you want?
I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.
You might want to think real hard about the amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
Why the fuck should I respect her?
No, I'm serious.  You know what Kurt Potter is?  He's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place. He's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when PG&E offered 20 million.  He doesn't work like us, Ed.  There's no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
How do you know that?
Here what comes?
The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.
Heck, yeah.  Come on back.  Just gonna need you to sign in here --
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
Well I hate it.
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
Whose number do you need?
You got more than one?
Return 'em.  Maybe you'll get your money back.
Better safe than sorry.
Doesn't matter.  Doesn't make one bit of difference.  Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so <u>nothing</u>?
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
I'm not in danger.  I have a dead bolt. Remember?
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
I don't do favors for you anymore.
Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
Yeah.  Who are you?
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
And code the signal to my private chamber.
We've discussed this before.
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
The temperature is dropping too fast.
He will join us or die, My Master.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
It can wait.
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
Now don't panic.  We don't know that.
Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
I take it back.
What is it?
That depends.  Where are we?
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
... just remember that, Ôcause I'll be back ...
I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
Yeah, you're a real hero.
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
Why not me?
You are reckless!
I see a city in the clouds.
That won't be necessary.
A display of primitive apparatus --
With food?
I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.
Yes...
Where?
You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
Say goodnight, Carjack.
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
What's the little black box do?
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
It's history. I gotta go.
Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.
Right over there.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Who?
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
Sewers. Come on.
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
Well, I'll think it over.
I've been doin' that all my life. Might as well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is.
Thank God.
Give me the prototype.
Move aside!
I sought only not to harm you, sir.
It is you, sir, who knows not the virtue of humility, as a true king must.
And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
Speak of the devil!...
Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
What book is that?
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
And you are the great King? The lords have rebelled. Invaders attack the coasts. Crops don't grow. There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land. Only I am feared. I will be king. You may have lost Excalibur, but I have found my own weapon of power. There.
And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy?
Because you and the land are one.
You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
There is one.
Love demands it.
You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
It is.
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
I am the desert, where water disappears--
Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
You didn't ask!
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
Just five or six people.
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
Didn't who tell me?
Sure you won't change your mind?
We still don't know.
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
What's her name?
Fine thank you.
Yes, I think so.
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Depression?
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
She used those words?
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
Oh. What are you talking about for Christ sake! Did you see her or not? She's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or...
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
Pretty close?
Pretty close.
About my daughter?
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
Like what?
Did you know my mother died recently?
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
What do you drink?
Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession.
Um........Stuff.
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
You know how?
He's nice.
Cause I like it.
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
But you like him.
Well your thinking's not so good.
God gets lonesome for us, Rags. He wants us back.
So something please Doctor, Help her!
St. Mike's.
Damien Karras.
Oh, Christ.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
You just missed them.
You and Regan?
No now.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
Amen
Don't listen.
I once did a paper on it
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
Who's in it?
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
...from this creature of God!!!
Yes?
Twelve.
Give me the keys.
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
Two at a time?
The fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.
What's the point?
Jack.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
Thanks.
Why the interest?
This time you gotta go.
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.
We don't get a gig.
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
That how you see it?
It never was.
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
Get out of here.
How about these?
Sunday.
No, you take the right.
I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
Because I can hear it.
They stopped serving two hours ago.
Time flies, huh?
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
No.
What?
Sure.
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Spur of the moment.
The flu.
What am I gonna do?  Put a record player out there?  Bad, Frankie.  Bad.
Blanche.
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
That!  You can't wear that!
A seven.
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
Zip me up?
They're nines.
Right.
Hey!
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
Yes, well, they are.
Born and bred.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Job.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
Pretty much.
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
I guess in case one year they're not.
Just dinner and dance, right?
Better than that.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
What's that supposed to mean?
How do you know?
Long story.
If I see him.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Can I stay here tonight?  Even if she comes here?
Merry Christmas.
They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
How old is he?
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
A few blanks?  Like what?
Is that what you think?
We need to talk.
Were you there to catch me?
Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
Would it?
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was "titanically remote."  Who knows?  Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out.  Or maybe God really is on my side after all.  By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here.
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
When did you start smoking?
Kim?
What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
You can't blame me for trying.
You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
I'm just having some fun.
Like I fucking care?  I'm not just sitting here!
Normally, I would.  But today ...
Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.
Ooh, my suits are ready...
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody’s here.
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
It’s not good.  Bob Thomas has secretly been talking to a European drug company. We’re not sure which one, Julia’s on it right now. Word is they’re willing to let him buy a minority stake and keep running the entire company.  The Global people are up in arms.  They say we should’ve been prepared for this.  We’re in trouble here, Jack...
I don’t know...
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
That’s where you work.
It’s just two kids, right?
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for god’s sake!
You’re right.  Why am I so competitive!? Compensation, I guess. Look, just focus, Jack. You can still pick up the spare...
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  You’re not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Look, maybe I’m not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtation’s harmless but you’re playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
Screw the rules.  I’m talking about the choice.
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we could’ve been really good friends...
I mean it.  From what I can tell, we’re a mom and pop operation, we’re already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
That’s my car!  You stole my car!
You?  What about me?  I’m working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
How much time?!
Why not?
Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
You know what the word glimpse means, J? It’s by nature an impermanent thing.
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
You mean don’t go at all? What about my internship?
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
No, you’re right.  What are we doing?
Pro bono.  You don’t get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...
You’re having a bad day, I’ll go with you...actually, there’s no way in hell you’re gettin’ me back out there...
HEY!
Well that’s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
I’m working on a new deal now...
It’s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven you’re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We don’t have time for wining and dining.
She got those shoes...
Sure.  I really like Annie.
How would you look at it?
I want it...
What...?
What? You make me hot...
Okay...
No.  Well, maybe a few things.  But mostly just different...
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
That’s a big one for me, too.
It’s wonderful...
For the week?
Please, just promise me you’ll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you don’t, then it’s like it never happened and I don’t think I could live with that.
You’re not married, are you?
Not exactly...  Can we just take a minute here?  Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
Do I know you?
You’re a little tougher, Peter.
Okay, I’ll take them...
You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
<u>Should</u>?
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
It's easy for you to be patient.
And they're changing into...
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
I wish I could tell you.  I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --
That's terrible news...
What about you?
You've been working out.
Oh, it is.
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
No: You're <u>ON FIRE</u>!
Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
<u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not <u>mine</u>."
Front page?
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
No, I distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door.  Ergo...
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...
Normally not. Unless it's an Arterio-Venous Fistula --
The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
And take a little trip with them...
Where can I get a cab back to town?
Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant.
Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
What do you mean?
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
I've done all I could with the laser.
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
Don't tell me they're refueling...
It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
The Lymphatic System drains off excess fluid from the Tissues. Without it, we'd all swell up like balloons. He reaches the console, begins to take out a new chart.
Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
Go ahead.
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
Looks simple to operate.
Not to the valve. But we've lost too much air to make it the rest of the way.
I'll do what I can.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
Well, see, there's a minimum charge of four dollars. Long-term parking charges by the day.
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
...Would it kill you to say something?
I did.
Well, okay, it's -
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
GOT IT?
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Oh, now he's adorable.
Mr. Mohra?
Uh-huh.
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
Uh-huh... A what?
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Can you be any more specific?
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yah, that can happen.
Uh-huh.
They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yah, real good.
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Okay.
Well... yah.
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Good day, sir.
lot. It's a limited -
No kiddin'?
Yah.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
Let's go take a look at that trooper.
Yah?
No way.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
Yah, that's me.
Yah - how are you doon?
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
Nope.
Yah, is this Marge?
Gustafson's accountant.
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
We've got a -
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
It's terrific!
Right, right.
Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men Together?"
Hmm?
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
You can't have the whole brain!
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
Should we?
Look, this is a bad time...
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Goodbye.
No... no problem.
Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
We've just lost cabin pressure.
Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
I'm begging you.  Get on the bus. Get on the bus.
Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away a couple of weeks, at least.
Who's this?
What?
Who do you think I am?
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
Somehow, I realize all of this -- the gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is really about Marla Singer.
Tyler Durden.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
Thank you.
What's that?
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
A nice, big cock.
You get the idea.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
This fight, pussy.
I know that.
I don't know how Tyler found the house, but he'd been there for half a year.
Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
Hemingway.  You?
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute...
Yes, I promise.
I said I promise!
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
We don't... ?
Tell him!
You know what I mean.
I'm not asking you to.
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
"Training?"  Tyler...
Why did you do that?
Why do people think anything?
This isn't possible...
What about Marla?
Stop finishing...
Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
Noooo, please...
... no, no, no...
What?
You and your friend.
Pleeeeeease!
Yesssss...
Too much school.
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Speed up.
She had the baby?
Random, sure.
What, you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago?  You're nuts.
Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
Yeah?
The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
He's not a witch.
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
Thirty-nine.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
Let us out!
Why do you think I was hiding?
Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' "Stepmom."
In Death...
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you call this?
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
That's what I'm here for.
Damn!  Leeches.
Yeah...
Guard barracks.  Take some shots.
Let me see.
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
I do?
You think you are... .
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
What's the job?
I was crossed-trained in gunships.
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
That's a pretty hairy ride.  Full Colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing.
Don't dance me, Kirkhill.  You'll be walking funny.
That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
Colonel.
You're not.
This just occurred to somebody, now?
Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
No, I'm fine... really...
Please... before you go on... let me tawk... okay... We've had a wonderful time together... When we first met, you said this wasn't serious and I shouldn't get serious and then you moved in and we haven't been serious. And I just wanna say that I have no regrets.  None.  And don't wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front with me... I want the truth. If you're seein' somebody else, let me know... You don't have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me.  Just tell me the truth.
Oh sure... Gotta believe in God.  But I don't think God made man in his own image.  No.  'Cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men.  No, I think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of God -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- I slept with a few saints and let me tell you... <u>Booooorring</u>!!!... And so the whole point of life, I think, is for men and women to get married so the devil and God can live together and, ya know -- work it out...  ... Not that we have to get married.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
What does that mean?
See, I told you!
Well, what the hell does that mean?
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...
No...no...we can't...we can't..
I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!
I was nine in the sixties.
Which ones?
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
What girl?  I didn't notice.
Uh... she was wearing a kind of... a flouncy kind of... uh... plain...
If you're going to murder me, that's fine... just don't laugh.
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
<u>What</u>!?
What's her name?
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ...  You know none of this is true -                           PARRY the Grail, the voices...                           Jack... There's a part of you that                         Come on...what are knows this isn't true.                             saying... I know who you are...                              I know who you are.. or who you were.                                   You're acting really- You don't belong on the                            No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent                        Jack... man....you're a teacher...                         Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?...                               
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
OWW...MAN...
What a gyp.
Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.
Listen, you're very nice... b...
Oh... You mean you don't want to.
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
You just going to sit there?
I hope they do.
No.
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
No.
I didn't get it, did I?
No, but it was very clever... I would of just punched her out.
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
Yeah, me, too...
All right...
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
You were going without saying goodbye?
Swimming?
Is he?
Yes.
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
Catherine...
Please, I'll see you later this evening.
No, the last time was three years ago.
What?
Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
Bullshit! Truck drivers know the best eating places on the road.
Perhaps...
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Aaron, how you doin'?
Then don't go out with me.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
Just get the fuck outta here.
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.
Wha'?
A bad attitude.
I think he's 18 or 17.
You gonna talk to him?
I'm a good friend of hers.
What?
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
Oh, thanks.
Creasy, how old are you?
We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want... Jane Doe?
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
Two bs?
No children?
Your aunt?
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Like tonight.
My pleasure.
Affirmative.
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
You find the source?
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
I guess not.
Of course.
'...with his legal wife, the former Sally Ann Cavanaugh.'
Ahem.  'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.'
Whoops.
Come on in.
Velma.
Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --
Right.
I know.
Fletch?
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
Cops are here. I can smell them. They're after me. Lie down, Gum.
Sure you did.
That's Brazil.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
Why don't you try suicide?
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
You sure those doors will be open?
Deal.
I wonder if that's his doctor.
That's one thing I did find. It's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile.
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
His bride. Cute as a button.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
Down boy.
Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?
Don't tell me I can't --
Come here.
Very good sir.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
I want something I can print!
Yeah.
No, I ain't got you...
I ain't -- got -- you.
I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
Question one:  Can I have some money?  Kidding.  Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny?  You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who?  What?  Where?  How?  Now.
Did she tell you anything?
All your friends call you Jazz.
'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
Why are all these people after me?
Are you okay?
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
Ye-ah.
Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
Twelve pack?
And hey, I appreciate it...
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
Fine!
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
Okay.  'B-y-e!
The point?
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
What?
Who brings it?
This side.
Sal --
No... yeah...
Goodbye.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.
I'm going to put them on the cat.
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
Fake it.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
Where from?
Yeah, I know.
Why not?
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.
How'd I know he had a knife.
He coulda been white.
Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
What about the last of the big-time spenders.  You make him?
The greaser with the blonde.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
Suspicion of what?
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
We're goin' now!  Goodbye.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
We put him to bed for the night.
What is that old building?
For dead bodies.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
I love you more.
Do you know how much I love you?
So am I.
About what?
No.  This isn't what you think.
Satch, would you listen to me here.  Just you and me.  Can I talk to you here, alone?
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Daddy, I'm scared.
No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
Queens, New York.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
What'd you just say?
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
October 22, 1969.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
You really wanna know?
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
Yeah, I think so...
Johnny, I know, but...
What?
We got him!  Dad you got him!
Huh?
Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
Longbranch...?
Huh?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys.  I don't need 'em.  What I need is a partner I can count on.  I care about you.  Not cause of me and your old man.  Not cause of your mom. But because of you.
That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
Which means he probably knew her.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
I'm sorry.  I didn't realize...  But she knew, John.  A mother knows what's in her son's heart.
As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the Nightingale murders.
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
I did?!  I broke the world's record.
Where's Shelly?
I know how to do it.  I mean, how do we do it in the hammock?
I love you, man!
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
Nothing.
The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
Sort of.
Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Excuse me, but I believe that's mine...
Stop worrying.  I don't think they'll bother to come after us.
Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.
But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
Happy Friday the 13th.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
Uh...yes.  But...
Then let's get goin'.  We can argue on the way.  You tell me what you need...  ...I'll make sure you get in.
What's it to ya?
Why?
Come and get it.
But what I get scared again?
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Of course not.  She probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it.  I still don't get it.  Why him?  I mean, he's cute alright, but...
Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
I think somebody's messin' around out there.
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
You food'll be right out.
Twenty.
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
Legs giving you trouble?
Not so bad, today.
Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
Get up!
Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
He was dead.  He had to be dead...
Until I hear the truth.
I've told you the truth.
I didn't kill her!
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
What are you going to do?
Improvise, of course.
My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit.  He might even pay some attention to me.
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
They're out of town.
No, I think it's just the beginning.
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
This isn't a request.
You can and you will!!
I don't know what to say...
No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The ship's only so big and there's certainly no way off it, is there?
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
Is the ship going to sink??
What did you find?
Big mess every time.
Very bad today.
Press a button and they give us money.
Asbestos lining.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
And he was there?
I think we Nought to wait.
I say we go.
It's your best play, Nicky.
What?
This could be it.
You know about Adele.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
Our Peter?
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
We don't even like each other, do we?
What do we want?
What's sexy?
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
That's always been my problem.
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
My back is killing me.
I can't find it.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
It's the kid's lucky day.
Now that's a complicated subject.
And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.
Because life is good.
Why does it matter?
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
What color?
That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Engaging.
One more time.
So do I. Over and over.
Is it true?
Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
It is the work of untouchables.
Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
I am. But I'm not so egotistical as to think He plans His day around my dilemmas.
He said he's in charge...
No -- neither do I. But...  but this man is a Christian and he has written --
Even as a boy I thought so.
I --
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England.  And I will use the courts.
Ahh.
Thank him for his letter, and put him in jail.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
Again?
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
The Mission Director.
A day or so.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
In case you get back before I do.
Not that.
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
New policy.
--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
Not like <i>this</i> one.
Honey, look around you.  The world doesn't want one like <i>that</i> one.
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
What do you add up to here?
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
No way. I've got to get out now.
Sure...
Where do you want to go?
Just like old times?
Whisky and a peach.
Really.
But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.
That doesn't hurt.
If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
... and live happily ever after.
I don't want to go there.
Texas is a big state.
Do you mean that?
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
I guess you're right.
You want to try with me?
What's wrong?
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
That certainly makes you kind of special...
No, I'm afraid not.
Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Just sandwiches...
Can't leave the desk.
That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back...
After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
A couple of weeks back.
How?
This is my brother's car.
Well?
I made a mistake.
What about?
Why?
Good evening.
No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
It's the truth.
Do you?
Go on.
Could you do me a favour?
No. I didn't know that.
Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
Tell me about the girl.
I don't know.
Was it Albert?
Yeah.
No. Frank was a good bloke.
Have another?
Thanks for coming.
They said he was drunk.
I left last year.
Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that?
At the Half Moon.
It just would. He was always the same.
Nobody seems to know.
Today? At the races. He always goes.
That's what he was saying about you.
What you going to do?
What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
I don't want to get rough, do I?
That's not always a healthy way to be...
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
Yes.
Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
Mmm...
You get a bad month, all of a...
For some sales pro...
Yes.
He is?
With River Oaks?
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
Just the act.
What?
Somebody...
Should do something to them.
How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
Huh.
That's what I'm saying.  We were, if we were that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like robbery, and take the fuckin' leads out of the files...go to Jerry Graff.
What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
Hey.
No.  Not actually.
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
What did he say?  He'd buy them.
You...
Yes.
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
Absolutely.
That's ridiculous.
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
It's a waste of time.
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
They stole the phones.
Yeah.
They aren't?
Where was I?
Yes.
No.
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
Excuse me, sir...
Would you excuse us, please...?
Who are you?
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...!
You're done, come down, and let's...
Get in the goddamn room.
Shelly, you blew the last...
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
The leads are assigned randomly...
I have to go... 
Is that it?  Is that it?  You want to do business that way...?
Yeah.  Yeah.
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
What does that fucking mean?
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
What are you trying to tell me?
Five thousand.  I kept half.
You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. 
I...what?  Are you, are you, that's why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to...  Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen.  Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  Twenty percent.  For as long as I am with the firm.  Fifty percent.  You're going to be my partner.  Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
John: John:...my daughter...
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
My wife told me to look into...
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
Kenilworth...?
Mm.
I don't know.  For me, I'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm.  Some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did. There was a sound she made...or, me, lying, in the, I'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me café au lait.  She gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete.  Eh?  What I'm saying, what is our life?  It's looking forward or it's looking back.  And that's our life. That's it.  Where is the moment?  And what is it that we're afraid of? Loss.  What else?  The bank closes.  We get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed...the house burnt down...what of these happen...? None on 'em.  We worry anyway. What does this mean?  I'm not secure.  How can I be secure?  Through amassing wealth beyond all measure?  No.  And what's beyond all measure?  That's a sickness. That's a trap.  There is no measure. Only greed.  How can we act? 
Gimlet.
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
Who did she call?
I'm not.
What would have elapsed?
And when was that check cashed?
We'll speak to her, Jim...
No, Jim.
The power to negotiate.
This.
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
They took 'em...
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
I'm going home.
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
They didn't get my contracts.
I...
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
I'm giving you three leads.  You...
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
Did you like your party?
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
You're not my father!
Then why do you come to me?
Tom is right.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
Forget it, just go take care of her.
We're making an investment in Havana.
You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.
But, you told me yourself...
I've always taken care of you.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
If I'm wrong...
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
Wait... there's something else.
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
I know he's in Israel.
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
No strings.
Thanks...friend.
Is he related to the witness?
He is, I believe, a brother.
Yes, Michael, it does.
Why too late?
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
Who do you think you're talking to?
There are still things I have to do.
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
Very impressive.
Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
Yes.
After dinner.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
We worked it all out beforehand.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
Just thinking out loud.
Funny is funny and scary is scary. You don't mix them.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
It still hurt.  A lot.
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
What are you then?  What will you be ten years from now?  Still cutting lawns?  Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
Tea is fine.
Yes.  I trust you.
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
Mornin'.
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
Just that I was in the Marines.
I stink to high heaven right now.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
You went to university?
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
It's new.
I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
I just feel more comfortable keeping it on.  You just said you didn't want me self-conscious.
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
I didn't --
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
I want -- I want...
Clayton is fine.
Exactly.  Cukor was too cheap to hire music.  There's nothing but chin-wag.  The cold dreary custard of English chin-wag.
David produced her last picture.
Never gave it much thought.
That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
Oh no, my friend.  It's digging itself up.  There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it.  All my diversions have abandoned me.  Parties.  Reading. Painting.  Work.  Love.  All gone to me now.
I don't know.
You're crazy.
Oh Clayton.
You'll feel better tomorrow.
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
Then who did?
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin Tin.  Dogs are so much more dependable than men.
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
After you then.
You're serious.
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"?
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
My monsters?
I've changed my hair, you see. Since our last session.  Those old snaps look rather dowdy now.
How they were just there ... Waiting on us ... The fix was definitely in ...
Yes ... Kip ...
You spend enough time down a man's throat, you get to know his tonsils. Do it ...
You know my back -
Let them go --
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
You'll leave -- ?
I don't think so, Detective ...
Castlebeck.
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
Yeah?
Gray.
And there she is --
What does that mean -- ?
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
You, too
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
You?
Me.
What?
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give 'em sixty ...
Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like
What for -- ?
I gotta get my tool --
Where we going -- ?
What's wrong with her -- ?
No. Open her ...
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
No worries ...
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
Not really --
Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
No more shines, Billy.
Wha?  Me?
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
Jezuz Christ!
I can't do it anymore.
Don't worry about it. You listening to me? Now, come on. We gotta go see Paulie.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.
We did it.  We did it.
Have a drink first.
Don't worry about it.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
Keep him here. I'm going for a bag.
No, no. It's okay.
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
What? Come on!
I'm sorry, 'cause you know Mikey, the fuckin guy loves animals, and this is the last person you'd want this to happen to.
Least I work for a livin'.  Why'd you get fired?
Oh great, tell her that! Now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
What?
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
Oh...
Okay.
I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--
Yah, all right...
I told you, I just got change.
Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
I don't have a VCR at my house.
Shut the fuck up.
Will you take a check?
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
And what do you see?
--But--
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
It's an integer proof.
No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
It's Saturday.
Who proved the theorem.
He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...
Five.
Not at all.
Who?
I do.
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you.
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
Hold up.
So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai engine under there? Can I make it back to my house?
If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."
What does?
I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person.
Yeah.
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
I didn't want the job.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
Look at me. What do you want to do?
It's not your fault.
That's what you want?
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
How many?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
No.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
No.
Some, a little.
--When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.
Then what are you afraid of?
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us--  --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
I'll get Rosasharn.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
Fan-belt's shot.
Short fella. Pale face.
Them was nickel apiece candy.
Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
Why, I guess so.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
They don't get in here. Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights.
Say, who runs this place?
Anything like work aroun' here?
Have a little snort?
Been out travelin' around?
I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
Ain't you seen your folks since then?
That's our place.
I ain't no preacher anymore.
We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
I don't know.
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
Got to learn, like I'm a-learnin'. Don't know it right yet myself, but I'm tryin' to fin' out. That's why I can't ever be a preacher again. Preacher got to *know*.  I don't. I got to *ask*.
Women is always tar'd.
*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
Get to what?
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
Yeah.
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
Take her with you!
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
I like the tent better.
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither!
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
She'll be awright.
I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people. 
I'm ready.
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
What's that--detour?
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
There, them stripy ones.
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
They gone.
But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
The rest of my fambly set out for the west--there wasn't nothin' to eat--but I couldn't leave. Somepin' wouldn't let me. So now I just wander around. Sleep wherever I am. I used to tell myself I was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. But I knowed that wan't true. There ain't nothin' to look out for. And ain't nobody comin' back. They're gone-- and me, I'm just an 'ol graveyard ghost--that's all in the world I am.
Won't they come out here?
But what about this?
Can you pick peaches?
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yes I do.
Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
Wonderful.
Not much, actually. My software company just went public so I'm just... hanging out, really.
You could've been a contender, huh?
What do you want to do?
I want to be an actor.
Then express yourself, Bob.
Ten years, I think. What I miss?
Where have I been?
Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow you... access... to my being?
Yep.
Bad people.
Bad television.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
I think they'll probably have booze there.
No.
It's something I do...
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
I work alone.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
It's only natural....
Because your problem is you're bored. And you have a very big mind.  I am part of what I call a brain syndicate.
Thank you, no.
No harm no foul.
Hard to get good help these days.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
Nope.
No...
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
In Detroit. This weekend.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
I have a headache. You have a headache?
No.
He sold me this bad boy.
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
I'm a professional killer.
That's good.
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
All by yourself?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
When I was first married.
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
Need a lift?
I can handle it!
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
Is that your version of a pep talk?
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
You don't.
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
I don't believe this!
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
Why? There's no food in the house?
Thanks, honey.
Did you go riding?
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Good.
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
Sure... What's Grace up to?
Tch. What are you --
The funeral's on Friday.
Sing it to me, Frankie!
Doing what?
You've already made arrangements!?
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
You're allergic to hay.
I can see why you put your faith in him. He's a genuine... good guy... Good at what he does. That's rare.
Take your time.
What do you mean?
No. He had the choice.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
I'd love to go there one time...
Yes, it does.
Promise?
Oh God, Annie, I'm so sorry. I... I know you're being hit with a low now, I don't want to take too much of your time but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim.
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
Diane!
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
Weekend after next...
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
I know you do. Don't you disappear.  You do whatever you have to, to hold on...  I'll tell you one more thing... When Pilgrim reared up to face that truck... you know what I think?... I think that damn horse loved you so much, he was trying to protect you... That's what I think.
You shut up, stupid!
We still have a way to go.
I understand...
I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
Now that's cool.
Cool?
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
Dragon book. Compiler design.
What is it with this guy?
The sensitive type.
Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something.
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
Dead?
Nah. I don't play well with others.
Blow me.
It nibbles. You see this?
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
Yeah. RISC is good.
Yeah.
I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that?
What?
Alright, let's boot up.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Dreams?
Uhhhmm...
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
The rabbit is in the administration system.
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
Just one moment.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.
Its about tonight.
Okay, I guess. I'll call you later.
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
Go!
Get up there Rachel!
Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
Can't you find somebody else?
How do you know their not?
We should call the fire department.
I can see this is useless.
We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
It was the nightmare man
Oh Rachel!
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Dad, what's going on?
Don't you mean what you do best?
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
I don't know.
Its not over yet.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
Hey. I got a town full of beer bellies running around in the dark with shotguns. Who's gonna be next? Somebody's wife? Somebody's kid?
He's here, Sheriff.
How do you know?
It isn't a man.
Evil.
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Uh huh.
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
Look where?
Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
Okay. Bye.
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
Bye.
That's probably all he can do.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
What's this big, big news?
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
Here, Lester.
Come with me.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
Michael's around someplace...
Yeah, sure.
Promise?
Could have...
I found the car! He's here!
It's your own fault and I don't feel sorry for you.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Sure.
Mom doesn't like me to have them.
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
Mm-mm!
Are you really interested?
A lot of works.
Uh --
And then, uh, April...huh?
Oh, is that what it is?
Right.
If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
Really?  Is the food that bad?
I cry at the opera.
...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
Yes.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
And it's just in one ear?
Yeah?
Ed Smythe, yes.
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
Oh, Elliot!
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Yeah, unhappy and fat.  And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
No!  No...
Oh, I would love to hear it.
I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.  I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you.
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
What do you expect me to say?
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
Lee...
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Why not?
I don't know.
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
Are you in love with someone else?
Leave me alone, can you?!
So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
No, thank you.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Based on what?  You never even see him.
What are you going to use for money?!
You've been with someone!
Yeah...but you're not dying!
Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
Yes, please.
Oh, me, I'm okay.
Really?
Like what?
She's going through a really rough time right now.
I got two minutes.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
...you know?  I, uh...
You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
Well, then a third opinion.
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
Okay, okay.
I'd have been a great dope addict.
No, no, we decided!
Yeah.
He's not a loser at all!
Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean--
Well--
But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
My--uh...
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Really?
No, the reason I ask is--
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
Oh, well.
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
Oh, who cares?
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
I'm going to tell you later....
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
I hereby acknowledge that...
It wasn't my day.
...you...
I'm looking for...
...aren't you afraid of me...?
Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
What's up...?
Impossible.
Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
...here's to child abuse!
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:
Am I on that case, sir...? 
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
Well, then, you have insufficient information.  I'm grateful for this opportunity to set you straight.
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
My scar is a war-wound.
You know America?
Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
...yes, yes, yes...
We got KittyKat...
The government says.  Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother.  The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home.  You can't see Mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or Kitty Cat.  That's what the <u>Government</u> says...
Sir, with all due respect....
You were given backup....
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
Indeed we were.
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
You're <u>free</u>...
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS! 
Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you.  Why dontcha gimme the gun?
Fine, thank you, but
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
...what a lovely perfume.
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
I don't <u>think</u> so.
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!
That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...
Of course you are. You don't know what I was like before I met you. You're like the best counselor ever.
Your Secret admirer?
That wants to be a Yes.
Don't worry, I have 33 more days to find just the perfect moment to tell him how I...
Nothing.
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
It's just funny...who needs a serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw when we have ourselves.
I don't know about you dickweeds, but I gotta go take a nice, long juicy dump.
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
I just never thought of you in that...
Yeah, why should we let our actual personalities get in the way of us falling in love?
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
Yeah. I guess I do.
Talking while kissing.
I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."
Not now, Wendy.
What do you want me to say?
Thank you, my love.                                         ]
Betty Finn. Gosh.....
That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.
It's not my style, okay?
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
No. Hell no.
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
But she couldn't handle it.
Jealous much?
Give it up girl!
Maybe it's time for a vacation.
See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
You can't be serious? Hey listen, my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.
Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
You must have had fun.
Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
Goddamn Geek!
May<u>be</u>.
Sure. Ciao.
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
Well, I guess I take after you then!
Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
What??
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
I understand, I think. Other women?
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
Just get better okay?
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
Getting paid for doing shit.
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
Zero's a number right?
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
But... I thought...
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
Can you follow them?
Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
It's getting hot in here.
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
LaPlante!
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
It's November.
Mister LaPlante...
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  Like you let everybody down, always!  What did you do, take a mudbath?
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
Me!
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
Uh, no.
Mmmmm.  Well, it's complicated. Maybe when you're older.  Anyhow, what I'm gonna tell you here is in strict confidence, okay?  It don't go no further.  What happened is, you remember that night I was gonna take you to the movies an' it was raining like a sonofabitch, ..?
Gale...
I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
A Silver Mike!  You're covering us in glory!
We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
Friend, that animal will go after whoever's approaching the sound of that whistle.  And God help whoever it is.  Because that dog will not let up until there's dead meat on the ground.  Put your faith in that, pal.
Okay.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
Sure.
You must value your independence.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
About us.
Mr. Sykes, I think you should go home.
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
Aw, okay.
Holly -- that's not so.
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
That's not the case.
"Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going."
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
We'll talk in the morning.
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
It's fun.
No.
Thank you -- how efficient of you.
No joke, Lieutenant.
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
What is it?
He had to come from somewhere.
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
Central Park.
You sure?
Is that it?
I see.  You don't care about life anymore.
As friends -- always as friends.
What worries you?
You.
How?
Sometimes.
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Because, it's for the best.  There are somethings that are better left unexplained.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
New York is dangerous place.
Why?
I've lived all over the world.
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
So?
Not unless they're immortal.
He will not stop until it is over.
Conner?
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
I don't know.
His head.  Someone cut it off.
I don't think it is a duplication.
The Kurgan was a pussy.
You cannot hide from me.  You will not stand between me and my destiny. After I have your head the power will let me hold any form as long as I want.  Do you know what that means? I can become the President -- I can become anyone I want.  The world will be mine.
No.
No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
It was stolen.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
The best.
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
He knows better than that.
No way.  I tell them, that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there.
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
That money's fucked up your brain. Talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed!
I'm not going to die for this!
I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
Let me come get him.
Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
Give up.
Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
You can't run with suitcases.
I got the gasoline --
Dennis.
Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he took those kids, we're fucked!
Canyon Country.
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
No!  I'm not going to leave Daddy with them!
I'm not gonna leave you!
Better than you getting killed!  Don't touch that gun!  Daddy says --
We can't make the microwave work.
Whatever.
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
He didn't say.
What's wrong with the radio?
Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile.
Order your men to stand down.
Then I think we should wait.  Do you agree?
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
-- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance!  <u>What</u> <u>is going on</u>?
It's right in front of us.
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
Think of me that way and you won't fuck up.  I'll handle the Sheriffs.
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
They've been in there all day.
If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too --
I think so.
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
Who is it?
Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
No!  They're right here --
How do I reach him?
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
Have you requested re-enforcements?
What was the response?
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.
We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
Very soon.
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
They moved you from the Diplomat?
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
What?
I need a great favor.
I will see what I can do.
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
How do you know?
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
Of course.
Murdered! By whom?
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
Stay with the children.
How can we help him.
No. They are not dead. Stop this.
What about us?
In Ruhengeri?
A car.
I want to know.
I have to go to the Diplomat.
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
That is why they call it coach?
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
C'mon.
Left, goddamnit!
Me? You've gotta be kidding.
Up here --
This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
Hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? I'm trying to get something accomplished here.
He's gotta still be down here.
We're safe?
For chrissake give me a hand!
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
-- wit...nesses --
No, no, it's just --
I remember...it was a long time ago...my father said: when the House was finally completed, make sure...we-christen-it- with-this-bottle-of-dirt-cheap-champagne- that-should-still-be-in a cupboard somewhere!
I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
Please! I need your help.
So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer.
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.
Believe me, we need to.
How, he's supposed to be dead!
Why don't you pass me your plate?
Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
Well then who did?!
She's hiding.
I want this one, daddy.
He's blessing the house.
For good luck honey.
Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
What?
No.
Oh come on!
Not going!  Are you out of your mind?!  Wait!
I'm ok.
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
Oh, that's nice...
The amulet...
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
And what would you do?
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
Right.  Right!
That's great.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
I'm trying to quit.
Taken what?
Every day.
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
Unh-unh.
Yes.
Really?
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
Anna, I think you better stay....
I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
Yeah.  The big E.
Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
God go with you, sister.
Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
Bunny, ball-ball!  Bad bunny!
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
Remember that shoe you lost...
That's the beauty.  It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con.
Alchemy.
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
I know that, Amy.
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
What a beautiful thought.
Huh?!
Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
Phony, huh?
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
Says who?!
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
Tell me about it.
I got big ideas, though!
Martinis are for squares, man.
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
But, Buzz --
But Buzz --
Wait a minute!
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
But, sir! --
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
He don't look wise.
...adenoids.
Looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- I don't know whether I'll be able to get away with it.
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
Thank you.
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
Did you hear what he sang?
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
I've never given it much thought.
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
What about her?
No.  You're quite wrong.  Right here's the seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  It's revived all their old superstitions -- Zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.
To the asylum?
Why?
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight.
No thank you. We should be off.
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
What do you think?
Hmm. Good night.
I do. I'm -- are you...?
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
Stuffed and baking.
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
You think I --
I know, I know. I had no idea --
Damn it, Ben --
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
What are you talking about?
What?
Nah.
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic.
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
Nobody.
It's not a bother.
Social work?
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
I gotta get to English class.
See ya.
Shit. You're not planning --
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
No!
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
Who said so?
Sure.  Twinkie?
Why did you -- with Sandy?
Wendy!
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
Huh?
That's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream.
What's that, then?
What's the D.A. got them on?
Four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft.
Don't worry about him...
Yeah.  All over.
Twelve years younger.
We'll get the other one, though.
Like I said, no.  We know about those things up here.
I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out.
That's right.
Seven years.
That's right.
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
Don't do this, Hap...
Long as it's fun.
Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
What was it?
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
No back-up.
Drop the gun, Walter.
Yes, and very beautiful.
But how did you come into existence?
What are we?
Nothing if not vampires...
Surely you know the one who made you...
Perhaps...
Then God does not exist...
Then blame the one who made her...
You said there were none.
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
I can't save her.
Louis, I swear I did not.
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
Is that supposed to frighten me?
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
You both did it?
I took your life. He gave you another one.
I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free.
And you never cried -
I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.
Yes...
Claudia, you torture yourself.
What danger?
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
So you felt it too!
Why should I be?
I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
I want it!
You've just done it -
Sure...
Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
CLAUDIA!!!
Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat.
It's just a room...
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans...
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
It's over, I'm telling you...
You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself.
July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
Sorry. Emergencies only.
Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
Yet. Nothing yet.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
Not me...no way...
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
...Nancy?
I'm fine.
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
I wasn't dreaming.
I trusted you.
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
How much?
Not anymore.
The rest of us see bathrobes.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
Hey -- shut up, okay?
I'll go find him.
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
It is my home.  My name is Hugo Albrecht.
I'll go up and take a look at the General —- perhaps sit with him.
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
In the meantime it would be useless to alarm the others.  Let them think it was a normal  And, perhaps it was —- perhaps it was.
Thank you.
I think she went to bed —— I saw her going toward the house
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Closer and closer —- until they bite into your throat!
She has never mentioned her family.
Thea is an orphan.
The General — you don't even know him.
You and your mysterious illness. A new attack everytime you are crossed — everytime you can't get your own way.
What if he is?
That your father and I ——
Wouldn't I?
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
Yes?
Her family name?
In the New York Morning Globe, the man who wins victory is always a hero. -
And I'm your friend —— but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
Everything's so simple. I like you.
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
All I'm asking is thirty days more . . .
Don't . . . George?
What did . . .
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
What are you, a mind reader or something?
I don't know how you know these things, but tell me –– where is she?
Where is she?
Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
That's the kid.
Yes, but what happened to George?
The Building and what?
Yeah –– yeah –– hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years.
Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Mother? What do you want?
Today, over at the house.
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink.
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
Oh . . .
Hmmm . . .
Well then, how do you know?
Oh . . .
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
Maybe you were born older, George.
How's that?
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
Have a good time, son.
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
What's that?
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Nothing.
I know, but . . .
What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
It's important.
How do you do.
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Uh-huh.
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
Eighteen.
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
Have you made up your mind?
Do you like it?
Don't you like her?
No, marriage is all right for Harry, and Marty, and Sam and you.
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Oh, shucks . . .
I hope that's the cousin.
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
Want to talk about it?
You bet.  Hang on....
The rope!  The rope!
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
In here.
Positive I.D.?
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
Right.
But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
Hey -- you can't do that.
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
Bartending?  I'm 17.
Not till next year.
Pop.  I'm sorry.
You said something about a camera.
Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
You're damn right that's what it is.
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
What's that supposed to mean?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
What makes you think there might be?
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
Can't you tell?
Good.
Careful.  What's wrong?
Yeah.   I think so.  Mike!  Keep it down, for chrissake!
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
Just one minute....
Someone has to do something.
What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!
Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
Yeah?  Then what?
Shouldn't he be at home?
I'm okay, baby, I'm here.  It's okay....
Shh.  Shhh....
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
I want you to meet my cousin.
Tina Wilcox.
None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
Shut up.
With you, everything's next week. I want to go skiing soon.  Tomorrow?
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  Which way are we going?
Power line.
Now you're talking.  Let's get out of here before we do find something.
I'm not sure I can.
Your ass I will.  Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.
Coming about, then.
Would you take him?
Maybe nobody will notice.  Let's get them back in the bus.
Go on, you're tired.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
And a missing man.
You buying?
Shit.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
Get out of here!
That we swim.
Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you.
Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
... Me, too.
How's your patient?
Sure.  Let's go.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
It's too soon to move him.
So tell Calvin.
Yes, you can.
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
You don't have to prove anything.
Nobody told me.
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
No, no.  That won't do.
I told you, something's upset them.
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
Should be coming out of it soon.
And I like you.
Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
Massachussettans aren't.
I don't know, it depends.
Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
As always.
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Take it up.
Hold still, damn it!
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
No, South Georgia.
Oh...
The world's southern most reaches.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Reach for the limit I always say.
That's impossible.
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
You know Overman?
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
I don't want to.  I want to swing....
He told me you both did....
Nowhere....
Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
I don't know...You...I don't know.
Where is she?
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
We'll be there....
He knows what he has to do....
Stop what?
I'm on the phone....
I won't....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
I'm just getting started....
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
I don't know how....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
I'm terrific... Come on....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
Good.  I have two left....
But it gets cold in winter....
That's hard to imagine....
I like to travel....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
The wind does that.  Ever been to the Bahamas before?
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Aye, aye, Captain....
I fly elephants for smugglers....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
You too, Michael....
The females have eggs....
I made them, man....
Hey!
Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
Gave them the day off....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
'A Moray eel....'
Mom....
It'll work....
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
You want to be careful how you talk to me... I'm about to become famous...You should see....
Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.
Deputy Brody will take care of it personally.
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
I hope I'm not intruding?
Two dogs. He should do the dogs.
Since when did you drink diet soda?
Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall.
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10.
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
Because I dislike her too much ..
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
No you don't. That's how you <u>think</u> you feel about him. That's how you feel about <u>yourself</u>. You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for <u>you</u>.
Then give me that Zippo.
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
I'm going up to the institute.
It's twenty of three.
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
Have you got a match on the bullet?
Have you got a print from the hand?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - <u>and a bill</u> <u>for seventeen dollars for its wig</u>!
Vehicle references.
Wrong cabinet.
Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what?
I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
My hands?
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
You just asked me to ask you questions.
I was married to her sister ..
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
Yeah, I guess I do.
Okay, this is working.
Listen to me, it's over.
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art I have not mastered.
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Well, take care.
Absolutely.
Same to you.
Well, I'm happy for you.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
We will be fine!
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Yeah, what happened there.
Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
So I'll see you this weekend.
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
I don't need you to "stick."
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
Oh, knock it off! _ 89.
You know I don't do "contracts." But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak.
Let's do it again.
Uh, not today, but --
Maybe you don't.  Because it's not just the money I deserve.  It's not just the "coin."  It's the...
Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
What do you know about dating a single mother?
Then you gotta have The Talk.
Well, this was another way to go.
You don't want to go home, do you?
Fine.
My husband believes in you.  We're gonna make it.  Bye bye Dorothy.
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
I'm fine.  What's up?
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
One way to find out.
What's a bad idea?
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
Oh, don't worry about that.
It’s not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
When did you have it last?
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
What about Eric?
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
Dr. Grant was.
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
I try not to.
Which one do you prefer?
Any weapons, radios?
What did you think?
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
I don't even know this woman.
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
We've got to transport it seven thousand miles.  Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member?
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
Are you insane?!
Oh, no!
Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.
Uh - - about two million.
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
They died together?
The - - agility.  You're right!
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
Anti-nature.
Yes.  It's not a criticism, by the way.
Hola, bienvenido
Why not?
Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
In a box under my seat.
Yeah.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
"Thunder lizard!"
You got me.
Not without massive sequence gaps!
Why?
Why?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you two, uh - - are?  I wish you the best luck.
What?  What can we do?
There's gotta be something - -
They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
Phone security systems, everything works.  You ask for it, we got it!
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
No, no... listen, when I get back to New York we'll meet with the Board.
We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
He... he's here...
His camera... it's still recording.
_Krueger_...
Compared to this guy... amateur.
Jason's. It came out of his chest... a hand with long blades on the fingers...
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
He's fucking nuts.
One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
My job is not to determine his guilt or innocence. That's up to the jury. My job is defend him.
You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
Did you?
A man must eat --  And drink.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
No, I left it in his office.
He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
Who's to say he ever will?  He's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone's toes -- In fact, I'm the only one he trusts and he wouldn't even look at a document if it didn't first come through me.
Well, I --
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
I wonder if I might look to see if there's an address for family -- I thought I'd like to write to them.
I know.
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
He's jealous, yes, but <u>that</u> jealous?  He's too cautious.
I've heard of it happening.
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
No, I suppose not.
Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
You see, Kafka, in all cases relating to the factory at Orlac -- which is what this paper referred to -- the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is, to all intents and purposes, the same authority.
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
It's ... lovely.
Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
Two... maybe three.
And I appreciate that so much, I really do - a sentiment that will be shared by audiences across America when they view my latest documentary sensation "Indonesia ...Hell Hole of the World". Ernie Hemmingway's agreed to write the narration. We're going out through Universal ... Laemmale's promised me fifteen hundred screens.
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
Yeah.
Coz of something I lost.
She was with you after she left Frank.
I said that.  Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --  So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.  And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
All right, then, an ordinary matter. I'm a quite well off man, I have a -- position to respect. I would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a -- certain kind of woman, I'm sure you understand. Do you? Well I'd like to buy Jane McKenna's book.
Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
-- OK?
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
Well -- she's dead.
What're you gonna do next?
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
Right back at the start, right?
Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
You're going back?
They don't scare me any more.
I think you're homesick.  I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful.  John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you.
Well as a matter of --
Yeah.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
What's in it?
Goodbye, Pete.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
I see you have people there. What are their names?
Oh, Christ...Ah, yeah...you want to know why mom's not here, right?
That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
C'mon, Billy.  I'm trying to work for God's sake...
I hate it.
Oh, for God's sake...Here.
No.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
Overruled.
Then I have concluded my questions.
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?
Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
And yet you fired him.
A heavy drinker?
More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?
I suppose...
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser.
She'll be back...
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Do you want the kid or don't you?
I lost him?  I lost him?
Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child, effective Monday the 23rd of January.  That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child, four hundred dollars each month.  That the father shall have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child's vacation period.  That's it.
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Ten.
Fuck you.  He's my son.  I'm staying with him.
Did it ever occur to you guys that Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person in the world to live with?!  Did it?!  For one thing she's always thirty minutes late.  You can set your watch by it--
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
Sure.
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
I will buy them for you.
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
All?
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
It is an island. American territory.
Where is Alsace?
I do not know, Holiness.
You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
Britain?
And, America?
In the Americas.
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
Is that true or pretend?
It is a story, you decide.
But, I have no experience.
I do.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
Too young?
I see that.
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.
That hurt my feelings.
<u>Hector</u>.
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
Oh, bullshit.
And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
What?
Who?
Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
You flew up here because your boss--
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
I didn't say it like that.
Alright, Jack!
Okay.
Take him.
No.
<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
Seconds.  Three, four.
Okay.  And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
Sheriff.
You threw it at me!!
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
Look.
Kevin, hey.
Yes, well...  famished.
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
No.
Myra.
Shitbutt?
Thanks, Ardelia.
I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions... On the afternoon of July 8, 1981, he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary. His mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an EKG. When the nurse bent over him, he did this to her...
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
He's my patient! I have rights!  I'm not just some turnkey, Miss Starling. I shouldn't even be here this afternoon. I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice.
Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun, too. Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes.
Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Thanks.
I think we may be, yes.
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.
You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not, what can they do? Take away his books for awhile, and no jello...  I know it got ugly today. But this is your report, Starling - take it as far as you can. On your own time, outside of class. Now carry on.
Why?
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...
Point taken.
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
Where?
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Not lately. But maybe someday.
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
It's much better than your shoes.
Maybe they'll catch up.
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
How many women has he used, our Bill?
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.
Then please - do this test for me.
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Because you weren't wasting my time.
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Mmm. And what else...?
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
Horses - and sheep...
I - ran away...
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
Later, listen, I'll -
But you could. You did.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Let's go with it.
I'm sorry.
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
What would you have me do?
I have nothing to go back for.
My letter...
You still have an aversion to the water?
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
What the bloody hell plan is this?
What?!
I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
Major!  Some day I think you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement.
Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
...No...Do not call myself much of a subject at all.
Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
What did you see, Major?
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
Thank you. How can I reward you?
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
The decision is final.
Fire!!!
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
My colors?
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
France.
Le mot d'ordre?
Yeah...right...
Was there such a thing?
Not exactly a big ocean country.
It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
Stay calm!
Fuck your orders!
Shit...
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
What's your air reading?
And it killed Bo?
I know that.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
I realize you must have gone through hell--
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
Twelve hours!
Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
Your pocket?
Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
Hardly.
Seven hundred for the pair.
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
I still will, if you don't mind.
It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
Where're the others?
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
No Harry, you can't.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
About twenty minutes.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand; I am not going to see them or the guns again.
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you responsible.
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
I mean it's fucking empty.
Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
I'll only be a minute.
I will loan you the money.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
I can't help you, Plank.
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
Neither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's on and burning bright for the masses.
Seven hundred each.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
Nick the Greek.
Six.
Er, well, twelve.
Er, fertilizer.
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
Just shut up.
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
No, sir--
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
Who's "they"?
I mean, follow orders, sir.
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
Charley Wade.
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
If it's too late--
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
I never met her.
You know who I am?
Well--
Dad--
You wouldn't?
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
Mikey look at this--
They were using M-1's, yeah--
Seriously.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday.
--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
I assume a lot of your business is from our people.
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- [It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid]
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
He was a unique individual.
Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
I haven't been out here for a while.
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
He was killed.
You ever play one of these?
Not if I can help it.
He squeezed money out of you?
And my father?
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
Yeah?
You got in late last night.
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
Weird what you remember.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
Yeah.
Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
Yeah--
Yeah.
I didn't want to be going around your back.
I appreciate you telling me.
You suckers haven't had a good day since the Alamo.
Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--
Sure.
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
So when did Buddy leave?
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
You going to tell him?
So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?
You believe that?
Yeah.  It's French.
Thirty-five bucks.
Why?
doorway) And who's that?
A Nix specialty?
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
Right.
Yes...
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
They won't tell you anything.
Some or it.
I told you --
You said you weren't with him for love.
I wasn't.
Nothing?
Quaid and Jennifer--
It's all right.  It's not hurting...
I... have... to.
Harry-?
Good.  There.  Yes?
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
No.  I'm not going near him.
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
No.  Not yet...
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
What about Swann's miracles?
I'd like to hear them.
What are you, my mother?
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
You know of him?
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
What about?
Harry D'Amour.
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
Not the Walter Wilder?
You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
It's me betrayed him.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Nobody's better off this wav!
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
I can't... I can't go any further...
Fuck you.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
I know, it's stupid.
I know. I don't either.
Charlotte, who?
I don't know.
Yeah, you don't remember?
Four.
Working.
I don't want to be.
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Can I enter?
Alright?
Like Japanese food.
It's ok.
Yeah.
Zoe, come say hello to your father...
That's ok.
Hospital?
One moment.
What?
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne.
It'll just be a few days.
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
...Well, I have the worst  headache, I have to go find some aspirin. But, call me, let's have a drink, I'm under Evelyn Waugh.
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
I believe in you.
Claire...
I don't know.  What are they?
Must be a spare set.
I found the pentacle.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
We're still going to be together.
Peter, are you okay?
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
Quiet.  Real quiet...
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions.
I hope so.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
You ready?
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
Kelson, hold on a second...
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
Trick him.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
So what?
When's your birthday?
I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
What's the bible for?
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
We need all the help we can get.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
Goodbye.
Nice suit.
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Yeah, right.  I don't know why I bothered inviting you guys.  I knew you wouldn't show.
So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
He's looking right at me.
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that?
I can manage.
Maybe she is.
No I don't.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
I don't remember that.
That's ridiculous.
Are you okay?
I just need to lay down.  I've been running around all day.
What'd you do?
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
Okay.
You're cold?
Huh?
Gotta wait til the press conference.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
What?
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
Just one word of advice for next season.
I just can.
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad showed me how to fight like Ali.
I don't like flowers.
Five seconds.
A ride home.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
Didn't know you cared so much.
Who's Spalding?
When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
Yeah.
He ain't Spalding.
That what you think?
I wanted you to.
It happens, right...
You want to go talk?
Not really.
Hey, what's up.
You weren't at my game.
The "man" again.
Least you got your priorities straight.
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
So that's it, just forget about us?
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Wow.
What?
Hey.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
Business folks.
At one in the morning?
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
Yeah.
Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
You know, people.
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
You came out early.
Okay...
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
What?
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
HEY FUCK YOU DON WATCH IT NOW.
Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
Uh-huh.
Brain and Lung.
Oh that's good.
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
LAPD. Open the door.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, but I don't know --
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
I didn't realize it was that loud.
Who was it?
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
It's not -- what's a 422?
Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched --
I'm sorry.
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
Bye.
No, no.
You wanna make a deal with me?
Ok.  I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
Yes.
Claudia What?
Diet Coke.
How much time do we have?
Can you hold it?
I'm, I need to go, I'm gonna --
DAD.
Sorry, little man.
-- and I'm through playin' games.
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
He's doing the interview with the lady --
Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
You're a friend of the family I presume?
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
When was the last time you talked to your son?
Go fuck myself?
Alright.  Thank you.
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
I would just want to clear some things up:
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
From '84 to '89.
Right.
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
When did he go off chemo?
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
I'm really sorry.
...ok...
Calm down.
I live alone.
Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
...you know...
Yeah. Yes.
Yes.
Fuck no.
Slowly or quickly?
Did you tell her?
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
No one else that I know?
How long with Paula?
I don't.
I don't know.
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
...I don't know...
You should know better.
She's asleep.
Are you her boyfriend?
I'm Bob.
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
What's MOW?
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
I'm trying to help, Linda --
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.
Yes. What? Yes.
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
Should be one-thirty.
You're late, not me.
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
hang in there, ok. I love you.
It's ok.
Yes.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
This happens....this is something that happens.
That is good.
Anne... The night we had together... I always wanted more.  But that one, it was enough.  Enough to make me love you forever.  I want you to remember that... and go on.  As strong as you are now.  No matter what happens.
You have prayed too much.  Your mind is weak.
He is your brother!
No, Louis!  No!
How can I serve you in this?
Replace the king.
You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
I have it all worked out.
More wine!!
Perhaps he serves a different king.
We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
Everyone back.
Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into the boat!  Now!
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
It is also a place of burial.
But I was on duty...
Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.
What use am I?
The Queen Mother.  Anne.
Best not to ask.  Shouldn't even talk about it.
He lures us to capture.
It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
Raoul is everything to me.
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
... You knew you had a double?
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
There.
... The ball... Continue.
No, Keeper.
Athos, the former Musketeer, has just fought with several of your guard, at the Musketeers' Gate.
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
Yeah?
What do you need?
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
What did you do then?
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Are you a regular there?
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
Bartender said there are motels south of here.
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
It was you who did the asking.
How are Molly and the boy?
Christ!
When do they go to press?
You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.
You.
What is it?
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
I'll pick you up in...
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
He had to.
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
Wait for the back-up! Will?
Let's get to the physical.
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
Are you okay...?
It's me.
No!
Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
Yes.
Yes.
Please, no.
Not me.
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
I don't want to do that,
What about the dog?
No.
Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night.
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
Blue is cold.
Mama was probably asleep.
I want to see you, too.
You going back down to Florida after?
Tell her I called.
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
That's right.
Thanks.
Go on to the house.
Yeah...
What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?'  He read the Tattler piece, didn't he?
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
Why should I tell you?
Then how did you catch me, Will?
Yes. I'd considered it.
I don't have one right now.
May I keep the file?
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
Good. You'll load these, Ever fire them?
Let's walk the route.
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
But wasn't it funny?
But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
Andy!
Oh!
I've never understood that.  It's just... getting dark.  But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
And you're just poor white trash!
No!  Andy, don't do it --
It's so dirty.
What is this, World War Two...?
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
It's working for Elvis.
No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive!
Yes, your Holiness?
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Oh.
I used to think you were original.
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
Where?
Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
Bob Gorsky.
Yes.
See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
It's already begun.
You all look the same to me.
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
Should Tank I.D. it?
Oh, God.
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
Morpheus believes he is the One.
You killed them.
No, it's all right.
... Yeah.
I need an exit!  Fast!
Goddamnit!
I know exactly what you mean.
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
You've never used them before.
I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.  Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air.  Yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world.  Because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
What's going on?
And you still believe I'm the One?
Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
What?
No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
Why?
Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
But an Oracle can.
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
Yeah?
The Oracle.
They're hacking his mind.
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
Neo, this has to be done!
So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
I can't!
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
Well the guy over there said...
'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
Salute!!!
'Thou art then a king?'
'Thou sayest it; I am a king.  This is why I was born and why I have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth.  Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'
Sure she is.  She's always in here with some different guy.  You know the way they are.
No.
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
Come on.
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
No.
Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
We'll settle it tonight.
$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
The green capsules in the top drawer.
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
Girls?  You call those skanks girls?!
Count it.
Come on.
Can you spare it?
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's like he dropped from the clouds...
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
Annie made them.
I don't like cake.
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
In my sleep.
'Yes'.
Do you think I need a haircut?
Olympic.
Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
Please.  Don't worry about him.  And above all, don't antagonize him.
Please, Drew.
Yours.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
You get not to go to jail.
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
Are you?
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
That's what he said.
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Some spot you pick.
My Doctor Lady?
I am.
The Board is waiting.
Are you?
Oh yes, I do.
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
I came to see you.
And I'll be a visitor.
I mean I appreciate that.
No.
I said get out.
I don't know who you are.
I am.
'Love will find out the way'?
Thank you for loving me.
Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Good night to you, Bill.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
You've got a deal.
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
There's one to every rule.
I'm not everybody.
Uh-huh.
Well...I don't know.
I'm her father!
And I don't give a shit.
Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
Which is what?
Are you threatening me?
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
Of course.
Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'.
Please.  Talk to me --
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
The 'question' --
Yes, Bill.  The question.
Good morning, Quince.
Bontecou Day.  Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants.
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
Hi, honey.
He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
You mean like you loved Mom?
Probably.
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
That's all?
He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
Then what is it?
You don't know anything about Joe --
I'm having a helluva time.
You and 'Honey'?
I agree --
'Her'.
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
You never know.  Lightning could strike.
I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
This isn't my room?
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
I don't want your fucking money!
You did explain, Lenny.
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
You know what we have in common?
She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.
Just relax.
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
And what did he say?
Where is he?
Yeah, I hated it.
What does he want?
I have this condition -
Kill him. I'll pay you.
Shut the fuck up!
Sweet.
Dying.
I don't remember. See, I have no short-			* term memory. It's not amnesia -				   *
It's good.
You've read it a hundred times.
Mr Gammell?
Lenny, is that you?
You're living.
He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
She couldn't.
That, and your thing.						   *
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
I'm not. I was the cop assigned to your			* wife's death. I believed you, I thought			* you deserved the chance for revenge. I helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night. The guy who cracked your skull and fucked your wife.		    * We found him and you killed him.				  *   MEMENTO - Green Revisions 10-4-99 115A.

A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
Lemon or lime?
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?
With the United Nations High Commission on Refugees.  Famine relief.
Turn around.
Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
Sure.
I got the item.
My end?
You do.
...and therafore there is no consequence?
What do you mean?
'Cause you don't lose loads?
Maybe I'm only one.
Hola, viejo.
Would you?  Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen.  But none of this will happen.  So it doesn't matter.  Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono.  He is my man.  And you are a smuggler moving a load...
...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
Something's wrong.
Port-Au-Prince.
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
Where?
Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow...
I am asking.  You to me.
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
What's your Miami PD badge number?
Okay.  What's up?
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
Sonny...?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
Goodbye.
White supremacist types.
You sure?
Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal.
You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
<u>You</u> give <u>yours</u> to me.  <u>We</u> position all the assets hauling our loads...
Alonzo, you don't need to go home.
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
Talking helps. Don't talk, you get muddled in your head. Hey! Now you just look at this here!
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
For what?
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
Don't say nothing about you either.
Twenty bucks...
No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
I'm zipping your fly, what the hell you think I'm doing?
Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
Right here, why not? I prayed in saloons, I prayed in the street, I prayed an the toilet. He don't care where, what He wants is that prayer.
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
Ziat!
Billy?
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
How far?
Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
I'll pay extra
Ah, look!  they probably know where the campers are
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
That doesn't seem so bad.
We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
I want to cut his throat.
It's already been cut.
I know where it is.
Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again.  You go on through, I'll catch up.
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
Who got the Frenchman out?
Yeah...?
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
What?
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
Hurry, the woman needs help!
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
You know what I mean...
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
How?!
Peter-
Ah...
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
What?
She used a baster.
Oh, Jesus.
Fuck! It broke the skin...
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
Thank you.
The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.
If you wouldn't mind.
Oh, like I could do that?
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
Pretty rough so far.
No problem.
It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
Show me the way?
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter. I go out of my way for you. I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you. And what thanks do I get? "You bought the wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on this paper, Annie." Well, I'll get your stupid paper, but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here, Mister Man.
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
--not fair?
--cliff-hangers--
But not you. Not with my Misery. Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any "experimental blood transfusion" that saved her life. Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul, so you'll have to start there.
What?
Yeah, yeah...
Oh...
Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine.
It's almost done. By dawn we'll be able to give Misery back to the world.
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
Four or five days ago. Why?
They're hauling Misery into court.
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
Marcia, please.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness?  I'm doing this because I have to.  Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if I can make it work ...  I might just have something that I want on my tombstone.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
Now you've hurt me, Paul.
Lovely.
An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
Where?
It's that time.  Go.
Then we got'em!
What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
I'm not ready!
Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy Baird's the name.  Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.
Uh-huh.
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
That's because I'm on my back.
And six billion in the world.
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
And that's the only reason?
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
He's touched your heart.  You're overwhelmed.  You need to think it over. You'll meet him somewhere in a month.  If You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in and getting you out.  Give me the ear piece.
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
No.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
I'm fine..
No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...
S.O.P..
What about him...?
This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like.
Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like.  If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
All ten million.
Fold it.  Fold it tight.
May take a little time.
We got it.  On your feet.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
There was nobody on the bridge.
I just need you to be safe.
Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
This whole operation was a molehunt.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Profitable.
Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.
Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way.
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
That's the question I want to ask Job.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
My contact is extremely shy.
No, weíre going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move!
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
Oh?  What's the problem?
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
Yeah.
How did Kittridge do it?..
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Iím dead and gone.  God knows what sheís had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.
They stamped it, didnít they?  Those damn Gideons.
Too wicked to have a drink later?
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
And I'll have the special fish.
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
I want you to stop seeing her.
Maybe.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
You are going to marry my brother?
Maybe I should come back another time.
Bus hit him.
Instantaneous.
Yesterday.
I've never seen a moon like that.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
But that's cause he don't know!
What are you talking about?
He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
We're here.
I'm really afraid.
No.
Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
No?
Never is a long time.
What?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
A month from today?
Yeah.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Everything's different.
Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
No more he's not.
No.
I don't know.
And you are a son who doesn't love his mother!
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
But absolutely!
Are you sure?
What do you do?
That woman was a student of yours?
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
What you don't know about women is a lot.
I'm a little cold.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
I'm too old for you.
You mean the whole house?
It's a house.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
What would he be doing down there?
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
I'm not interested.
King of the WHO?
The Britons.
I am your king!
Oh!
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
Oh, please!
Come on then.
What?
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
Stop that.
This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.

There are some who call me Tim?
I'm thirty-seven.
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Bloody peasant! 
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
I'm getting better!
What is the capital of Assyria?
I dunno, Must be a king.
I can understand that.
Camelot?  Are you from Camelot?
But, Mother ...
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
Well ... I'll tell you ...
Leaving the room ... yes.
Yes?
No, not anyone else - just me.
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
Quick!
Why?
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Please ... we are doctors.
Not down south you don't.
What?
I've got my duties to attend to.
I can't move to tidy.
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
Of course.
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
Do you know who you address, sir?
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
And that is my last word on the matter.
Back and upper corridors.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
Aye, do.
No.
I beg your pardon?
Yes, it most certainly is!
That can wait till the weekend.
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
No love.
She'll never understand it.
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
Ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
He thought so, yes.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
Are they worth reading?
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
Yes, ma'am.
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
Yes.
So?
What's her excuse this time?
Dear oh dear.
No, indeed.
The same, your Majesty.
Just them?
I have no idea.
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
Ma'am.
Then why are you not with him?
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
How do you do that?
He?
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
How'd you know it was us?
What the hell does that mean?
So how did it know my name, then?
You imagined it.
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
...but then it hits the relay stations...
It's already out.
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
You've got the schematics, check.
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
So tell me you're okay, then.
And then keep on driving?
Oh God...oh god...
Yes...but...how did you...
Sign me up.
The Air-Force is working on the same thing.
They fired everyone.
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
You gotta be kidding?
I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
I agree with what you said...truly.
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
Was anyone hurt?
Oh...
You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn.
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
What is it? What do you see?!
Go ahead.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy.
Could be unrelated.
That's what I'm thinkin'.
Oh yeah.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
Not a coke or anything?
No time. Get him up.
Leave him, he's dead.
Why should I ?
You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
I'm working on it.
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
How long till the room fills ?
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
The Brooklyn Bridge.
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
Why ?
Swimming, you know, like in water, moron.
Thanks...
Where ?
But, he's...
I said NO.
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
Fire the whole division.
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
Sir ?
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
Better, sir.
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
The power went out in half the park.
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
Thank you.
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
My own sit down Star Wars arcade game. Wanna play it ?
Yahoo !!!!!
Shut up ! It's me.
Hey buddy. You okay ?
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Ohhhhh.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
Your Uncle Phil told me.
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
I don't think you're very polite.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
So, what's on your mind?
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
Of course.
What??
Totally groovy huh?
I love you too sweetie, bye.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
What're you saying?
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
You mean, you knew about me?
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
I've got something better.
We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
ehh...I don't know I mean....
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
I won't.
MOM!
Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
Oh my gosh, here it is!
I'd never do that.
Get married?
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
He is one of the great poets.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Just come and get it...right here!
Oh no?!?!?!
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
Really?
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
An adventure?
No?
Good-bye, look in your backpack.
For the mini-bike fund.
Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.
I don't think the color of the interior is....
Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
Sounds like you're very organized.
You know where the fire extinguisher is.
Bye Niece, Vada.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Oh, sure okay.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
I'm definitely traveling some day.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
WHAT?
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
What?
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Yes.
It's there.
Uhh, Miss devoto...
Yes they are.
Stiffs??
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
No, why?
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Did you ahh, love him?
I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
I don't know which ball's mine.
Hand me the canula.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Dad??
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
She likes to play bingo.
Why?
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
For this class?
Get away from me!
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
My Dad was funny?
Oh.
I am.
I would.
Mostly love, and romance.
Have you ever tried any?
See food!
NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
Oh no!  UUH.
It's a mosquito bite.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
Come on, it's fun.
Heaven.
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
Sorry.
Go???
Do it!
Sure.
Bye Ma.
I wanna live with them too.
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
It is not.
Okay on the count of three.
Just, hurry.
You should look like you dressed yourself.
The wandering sportswriter.
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
I'll have to kill myself before I call him.
Because I realized.  When I see him say "I do," that knife will be in my heart.  And it will be there every...
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Well, we're...
Let me rephrase that...
I was gonna predict that.
Exactly what?
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
... look good on Kimberly.
You are <u<so right.  What a nerve on that guy!  Bring my dress to church, huh?
I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!
Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
Endearingly absent-minded.
Quite the little eccentric.
At first, I thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!
She finds him "personable."
Boy, those were the days.
That's my point!!
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
She admits it's her fault.
Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
Well, it happens.
DON'T SPEAK!
If you find her...
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
Like family, huh?
... and you knew about this.
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
I hate that music.
I know that, Star.
Come on.
Is there food?
I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
Okay. Thanks.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
He knows better.
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
What does he want?
You know better than that.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Minimum.
Okay.
Where the hell have you been?
To the bathroom.
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
Let me know when you do, all right?
Your brother?
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
What did you say?
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
You got a place to stay?
Get in.
Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
Do you carry door handles?
Sixty-three.
Nashville.
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
About three years.
Tom. You remember?
Who is this?  It's Tom.
I don't know who you are.
What?
Oh?
Wrong.
Older.
Come on, you ever been attracted to a black guy?
Oh.
Money's no object.
For him?
You're not.
Where are you going?
Mary?
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
Ryan O'Neal.
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
More or less...
Yes you are.
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
Try to keep it to a minimum.
By all means, knock yourself out.
Who is we?
The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please.
You've heard of it?
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
You're taking us to that holding cell now.  All right, Cut!
Look, I'll trade you.
What I'd like to do---
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
Do you miss Mallory?
Yeah, we have a van.
No.
We'll all be killed.
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
Only on a much grander scale.
Jesus...
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
Wayne Gayle!
Two-thirty. Shhh...
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
Slate it.
How so?
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
Out.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Walker and Williams.
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
You must be new in town.
You working?
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
I like a place with lots of life.
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
Yeah?
He could live with us.
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm not really thinkin' about it. Anyway, don't want those white guys laughin' up their sleeve at me when they see me pull out.
You can have what I've got. It's right there.
Stop bein' so damn understandin'.
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
'Round town.
Like a home, for one thing.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
Okay.
Plannin' on getting married?
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
I heard you! Now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Well, what're you going to do?
Going back, huh?
Okay.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
Oh yeah?
Hell, they're all after the same thing.
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
He's my son!
Let's stay here, Will.
Okay, boy, beat it.
No more goddamn talking!  I want the bitch or I'm gonna do the girl!
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
Dixie McCoy
Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
I don't have a girl.
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Yeah. That was me.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
What are you talkin' about?
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
No, It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.
What about before that?
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
A regular Fagan.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
It sounds like you.
So... did you get a look at heaven?
Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
I know you have. C'mere.
...And if I guess wrong?
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
We've still got to find the mainframe.
Like what?
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
Oh I know.
Thanks.
It is?
No Roger from op/ed?
What about the "Roaring Twenties"… or "The 80's"?
Roger in Op/Ed.
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy—  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
Very romantic.

Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
You need my help?
Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Do I want to be crunched?
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
My sword.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
Better than I...
I-
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story.
Thanks. So do you.
I don't know.
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Well, a ball player.
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
<i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
He stayed a long time.
Experiments?
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Just out for a while.
Don't tell me it's not the gas!
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
What is it then?  There's got to be an explanation.  Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
Where's Jesse?
Naw. Just killing time.
Shut up, Grady.
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
Ghostbusters are fearless.
I don't know - a sharp pain.
Sure...go ahead.
Yor dad picking the music again?
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
I thought I'd wait for you.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
Wait and see.
I gotta stay up, Max.
No, she's right.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
You did it the other night.
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
It's been a long time.
That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
Remember -- open mind.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
Mary Helena.
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
I'll go straight to Carver if I have to.  He'll either back me up or accept my resignation.
Well... a shot at it.
Night, night, Honey.
Thanks.  I'll think about it.
Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.
No.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Bye.
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
Obviously.  Very difficult.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
Okay.
What did you say?
Why?
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
Your boyfriend?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
Oh no no -- no.
Cartwright.
Yup.
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
Yes.  Always have had.
No.  What's that?
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
Well...
Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
Don't even ask.
Yes -- sort of...
No -- it's my 22nd.
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
It is great, isn't it.  See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
What's your name?
Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making 	that bit?
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
No, no.  She doesn't.
Wouldn't want that...  Okay -- just one more.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
Oh.  Right.
I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
Oh sure.  Of course.
Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
Thank you, ma'am...
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
Sorry, ma'am.
Yes, Mister McMurphy?
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Thank you, ma'am.
Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.
Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy.
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
Wow! They're so quiet.
Sure, Mack...
Huh?
Shhh...
That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck?
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will!
No!
Hear what?
That's a dime, Martini.
Hit me.
He's not!
Oh, what was that?
To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure...
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
I'm afraid not.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
We'll let you know.
Replacement coming in! Harding out!
No, 'fraid not...
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
All right!
Yeah!
Yeah, what's up?
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
What are they?
Yes, ma'am...
I'm sure you will.
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
I thought so.
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
Buona notte.
Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
Your hair... is perfect.
Let's find a telephone.
No.
Dwayne Pinsley.  From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.
Ask her if she knows where he is?
No.
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
My name's 
He's safe.
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage.
Mickey Spillane?
Hi.
What?
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
No.  Course not.
I know the feeling.
Are you asking me out?
GET OUT!!
There's no such thing.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
What would you call it?
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
Uh huh.
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
He's a podiatrist or something.
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
Men have ways.
I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.
You sure you'll be okay?
Is Damon Bradley here?
No one's perfect, Kate.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
But I do want to.
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
Good strategy.
Whatever.  And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever.  And He did. She told me the name.  Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
I'm gonna take her home first.
Sure we keep records!
Listen kid, I'm a soft tough too. Ask any rummy  on the dock if I'm not good for a fin any time they put the arm on me.  But my old lady raised us ten kids on a stinkin' watchman's pension. When I was sixteen I had to beg for work in the hold. I didn't work my way up out of there for nuthin'.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
It's a living.
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
Yeah— yeah— I guess I do— but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
What the hell!!!
Four thirty-seven— that isn't where Gerry G...?
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
Which side are you with?
Everybody knew him. He got around.
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were—
Do you like pigeons?
Thanks anyway.
Good. So do I.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
The things that go on.
It's quite—  –nice.
Listen— get this straight— don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt— What more do you want?
I don't rate it.
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
That—  —word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
I keep hearing it and I don't know what to do..I don't know what to do... .
I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
My pigeons... .
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
What do you want from me, Father.
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
Wilson— yeah—  yeah— I fought Wilson.
Raise a hand to me and... .
Boy, you must've been up early.
Be sure they got enough water.
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
Take it easy now, Terry.
Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey.
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Hey, Terry, front and center.
Not a dent.  Perfect
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
Now just a minute, I—
Not that free.
I can't believe it— a small fortune.   You can't buy me— you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
Look who says bum!
Nolan... .
Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
There's an old cemetery on this road. I've been there before.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
Can't we get out of here?
What do you mean?
The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
Well then let us proceed.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
Oh, if there is only time!
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.
Who is it?
From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...
His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you and me figured the whole thing out.
You're right.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
Sure looks that way.
Now you're talkin'.
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather.
You tell your sister about it?
How long you talk to her?
Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
Yeah, and I better call my sister.
Whatta you wanna do?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
All you gotta do is get in.
Coming to the Okeechobee exit...
It was an unusual experience.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
Low class of people there, Snoop.
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
So you've done this before, huh?
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
Hey.  You learn from doing.
You're right.  So why take a chance--
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor unfortunate offenders.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
Is that right?
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
You have to be kidding.
Yes.
Why not?
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
Love it.
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
How far do we go with this?
I called your room from downstairs.
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
She did, huh.
I'm just going to the bathroom.
Looks like tonight.
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
Of course not.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
Hejira.
Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
Like what?
I remember you now.  Shit.
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
Jesus, I don't believe it.
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
I'm freezing my ass off.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
It's a guy you know.
Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.
He took the week off so we'd have time together.  So far he's worked on his boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.
Just a minute.
You not with probation, one of those?
He said he stayed with Maurice.
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
What'd I say?
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
I don't have any idea.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
Ten gees.
Are they dead?
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
Home of the brave!
It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
I was grieving too.
I got a half a tank.  You?
Yeah.
You were more like brothers.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
Y-Yes Sir.
Thank you, Sir.
We can explain, Colonel.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
Sorry to trouble you.
Nice to meet you, Betty.
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
It must of been a convincing letter.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war.
And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
God help them.
Learn English, then!
I'd take better care of my teeth.
The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
Why do guys do such stupid things?
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie.  Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.
I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
Right. I promised my mother.
Come on, let's dance.
You really love me, don't you?
A lot's happened since last weekend.
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love —— Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
But what has to be different?
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
It opens, too. Look inside.
Come back to me.
She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
Is that one of your poems?
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
I can't do that.
You think so?
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
I think I'm way ahead of them.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
This morning was good.
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?
You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
I had a dream that Grandma died.
For what?
I don't feel very festive.
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
Dancing with you.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
How, did you know about my grandfather?
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
There's one way to find out.
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
Come on. You can't be serious.
Silicon is from sand.
Exactly! I thought it might be some sort of blood condition... immune deficiency or...
God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
What do they do up there?
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
It's been a few years.
Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
The old Indian burial ground.
You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
You think he'd believe it if he did?
In a word, Bob...
Bob...
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
A carrot?!
One week old.
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
Correct. I don't.
Fine.
Find a lawyer?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
No. They didn't fire her.
Thank you.
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
You're right.
What happens?
What kind of person is that?
You didn't look then, the way you look now?
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
If it please the court, I'd like to ask Mr. Beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an <u>accurate</u> idea of what we're talking about.
Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
I guess it was 1984, 85.
Answer the question, please.
Were you recently promoted?
Your earrings?
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
Why are we going to do that?
Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an AIDS test. Are you crazy? But thanks for the information. Really.
It satisfied me.
I might.
Second.
Give me the camera, Joe.
Lots.
Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My cousin Tommy who lives in Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of the partners. His lover, Greg. Stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets.
Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.
Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
You had one guy "like that?"
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
If you feel differently, Bob, you should say so, when you're called to the stand. After all, this isn't a conspiracy.
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
We can, can't we? Trust you?
What, you're afraid?
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
Like the light is scalding it.
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
Not sure. Ten?
Possibly.
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
Like what?
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
60 years ago.
Let's wait on the power cells.
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
Smoke screen for what?
Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and <u>that's</u> why you can't come up with a better plan.
So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
For now.
Riddick?
Has anyone checked the coring room?
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
Wanna rag your fat mouth?
Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
Don' look, don' look, don' look....
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?
Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.
Shut up.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
And they fell out of the sky with you?
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
Zira....
Yo!
Geiger counter?
Yo!
Let's find them all.
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
He's trying to form words.
What signal?
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
Zira doesn't want your female.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
Fine. Just let her out.
Relax. You'll see it all later.
I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
Okay.Up to the cave.
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
What is this?
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
But perhaps he understood --
But there's the doll, sir.
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
Barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. We'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. It'll be a massacre!
Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.
Fuck you bitch.
Y'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man. 
Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
March man in Tennessee, sniff the pines... sniff that crossmounted pussy walkin' down by the river. What you got Taylor?  Let's see three hundred and WHAT?
If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
Indefinitely?
I'm sure you have.
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry.  Otherwise they might think...
And do you amuse the guests?
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
Sure... but somebody always does..
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
No thanks.
Dance? Tonight?
Why not?
I know everybody. I don't look at half of life, just the nice half, I look at all of it.
I didn't notice him.
Anything I can do about it?
So have I.
From you, I like it.
They're going to arrest me.
I have my own warrant.  Stop a minute, please.
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
The best interference runner we've got.  He thinks he's in love with you--and he's a gentleman.  Come here, baby.
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
Killaine's wise to what?
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
No.  I paid him off.
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
Beer or ale, Miss?
I'll have to know a little more than that.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
That's an evasion and you know it.
It is?
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
I'm enough of a copper to do my duty.  My boss made it tough for me.  If I don't arrest you, I've gone soft.  If I do, it's to save my face.  I don't play those rules.
I know that.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
Name it.
I don't know whether to knock your teeth down your throat--or call the police--or just give you twenty bucks to go out and buy yourself a clean nose.
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
Get it in half an hour.
Sometimes.
The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
The usual grind.
If I can get off.
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
I don't.
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
Would that make me a heel?
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
What?
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Mr. Mitchell.
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
What do you want?
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
You nasty, sardonic--
He saw my face too.
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
Recently, then.
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him.  I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
So far.
The card says so, doesn't it?
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
Ye have, have ye?
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
Not too far, I hope.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
Correct. I couldn't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
It's fine, thank you.
If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
I think you'll do very well.
Well, we were just...
Yes.
Oh, many things.  Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve.  We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge.  A new broom with very old bristles.  When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism.
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
...break away completely from--
That's her.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
Well, you should.
No jokes.  James is in love.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
I've known Susan for more than fifteen years.  James, we're old allies.
Suez.  1956.
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
Take a look at these.
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
No.
She said that?
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
Okay!
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you want to do it.  You're gonna die, Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four...
I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
That's the point, isn't it?
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
Thanks for the tip.  I needed this knowledge.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Kid, get outta the way!!
Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
This gonna take long?
Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
What are you talking about?
I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.  He'll take you to the edge... and past it.  Hey, Bodhi.
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
The best friend I ever had.
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
He's not really my uncle.
No.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
You're making the right decision, sir.
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
Yes.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Sit... and spin.
Not exactly.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
For an hour.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Oooh, thank god.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
No?  Why's that?
"Occupational hazard".
... dollars?
What?
But you want days too.
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
Shall we mingle?
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
Stuckey!  He wants an "appointment" with me after you leave.  You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
You won't.
Huh?
What happened to him?
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
But don't they have it in English?
Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
The young lady staying in your room?
We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
No one you know.
We're letting them slide?
Sales, really?  That's great. What does she sell?
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
I'm up.
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Dummy.
What kind of school?
Do I!?  Momma!
I... Edward...
Me?
Miss Vivian.
Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
Should I be?
Brides often are, I'm told.
They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
And what am I?
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
But what if something happens to you?
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
What do I do?
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
Yeah?
Over the Albino, I think.
I'll be right back.
Has it got any sports in it?
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Do you want me to go on with this?
Try ruling the world sometime.
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
Are you a rotten liar.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
You never had it so good. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.
I'm not listening.
Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
Get on the phone.  Send out a casting call.  Call every agent in town.  I want to see everybody. Everybody.

Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
What was I saying?
Yes, it's quite possible.
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.

That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
Ta.  Ta.

"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
We can't... we keep our money there!
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
What?
I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time.
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
A lot?
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
Where?
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
You've led a charmed life.
Where... can I stay?
Does that mean we can't...
No. I'm just procrastinating.  People hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.  Come on.
Yes.
Huh?
Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us.  Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped, so he must have found out something!
Hospital clean.
It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
Can you?
I can come down next week.
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
You have a vacancy?
Norman Bates.
Not really. I hear that expression, that one eats "like a bird," is really a falsie, I mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot.  Oh, I don't know anything about birds. My hobby is stuffing things... taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds because...  well, I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... some people even stuff dogs and cats... but I can't... I think only birds look well stuffed because they're rather...  passive, to begin with... most of them...
Only my share.
Why do you ask that?
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
Norman.
Alright, Miss... 
Please... I'd like to go...
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
Norman took a wife?
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
What--special autopsy?
Did she talk?
Then you knew of the inheritance?
Who are you? What is your name?
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
I don't know--I can't tell--
Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
So--that's it. Buckley took the body.
How? What can I do?
The wound is bleeding!
That called ... commanded ...
What did it say?
Yes.
There's no child here.
But ... the dogs...
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
At any time. You will always be welcome.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
I'd love to.
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
I'm going to make you eat dirt, you soap bubble! I'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go!
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
How's every little thing?
Hotcha! Saved, one job!
Here's a wow.
Who? Old Santa Claus there? That's easy for anyone with my sex appeal. He's a pushover. Watch me stand that old dodo on his ear.
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
Oh, is that what caused it?
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
If it is freedom to represent people with limbs that don't match -- cripples -- you have achieved your purpose. Anatomy! Heaven forgive you. You must have studied with a sideshow of freaks!
I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
I'm heading out of town.
How?
Nobody.
They were just bad men, that's all.
In what sense were they bad?
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
But why, if I'm not hurting you?
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
I said I wouldn't.
He did?
Five hundred rabbits?
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
What's taking the rascal so long?
Walked, in all that heat? It's a wonder she hasn't got sunstroke. I'll phone Daddy and you go get Doll Baby and Waski.
Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh-dam stuff.
She's watching the car again?
Yeah.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
Is her husband sick or something?
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
I'm not blubbering.
What?
I'll take him with me downtown.  And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride.
She will succeed.
Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
What time is it?
Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
Better off? How could she ever find love and happiness, if you did what you're talking about? Are you insane?
No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
Now Rose, stop behaving as if you're Bo Peep. Those men had a flight last night because of some female in this house, and it wasn't Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.
Well, I don't know what happened. They were arguin' about baseball, then all of 'em started fightin'. As for that policeman, I didn't bite him, I don't think I bit him.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
Am I supposed to take this information and sit up in the hills with a frickin' telescope?
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Who cares?
Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
She's fine, as if you cared.
We'll share.
What of it?  Haven't we waited forever... ?  Haven't we, honey?  Haven't we waited long enough to get this scumbag?
It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
Yeah.
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
What day is it?
Feeling great.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
Bullshit.
No, but it should.
It's go time, Billy-B.
Follow me.
We have to find Kittle.
Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
Then, why'd we tie him up?
Speak for yourself.
Can't I?
Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
I know it is, even if you don't.
Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
Come again... ?
I don't think so.
Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe.
Good.  Thought I was imagining them.
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
Here's the terminal.
Lando!
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
All right, hang on.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.
So, you have accepted the truth.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
Janet.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
We must have a blow-out.
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
Oh don't be so shy.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
Makes you cry
That ain't no crime
Oh.
To you, to me it's Thursday.
And you never got the chance?
...Guess.
You sure?
It's fine.
It's okay.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
Yes.
Don't want weak legs.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
...What's to say? I dunno what he wants from me --
...Yes --
...What?
Yeah, I can't beat him.
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
One more round.
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Kiss my ass.
Move your shoulders down.
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
...Ten minutes.
I only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
That's it, I'm broke.
Ya still light seventy.
...Fine.
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
Paulie's sister.
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
What?
Why?
Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.
I said, how ya feelin'?
More like thirty.
...Did ya fight last night?
Did ya win?
...No.
Here's the card?
Yeah.
I'm here tellin' ya to be very smart with this shot. Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
Heart, but I ain't got no Tocker.
Yo, Benny.
Damn! How's it look?
Why don't ya tell 'im you're a fan!
Fine... That guy's great.
Would you keep goin'?
It ain't your locker no more.
'Bout what?
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
...Sure.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
Ice skate.
It don't matter.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
Ain't sure, what's the story?
What can I do about it?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
Toon cops worked me over.
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
A joker to the end.
That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
I don't work in Toontown.
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
As soon as is humanly possible.
Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
Have you got the will?
Stop what?
Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!
You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Good-morrow, cousin.
Good heart, at what?
Teach me how I should forget to think.
Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Hold Daughter!
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
Farewell.
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
What?
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
If my heart's dear love--
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
And so did I.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew- dropping south.
Right.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...
Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
And then...
Nothing.
From Interpol?
They're good!
That's right.
That we're too stupid to trace his calls.
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
We'll double your price.
What's that?
I take it you still want the money...
You've told me a lot of things, boyo...
Now that is an interesting proposition.
Of course.  Don't you?
Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
Call it a reckoning of character.
Created?
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
Is that right?
It's been known to happen.
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
What's the difference?
Well I ain't a cop.
But you can't.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
How could you have done that?
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.
Right now?
Something like that.
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone.  How about you?  I thought all you IRA types smoked.
I'm alright.  And you?
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
The horniest dog in Nevada.
Hell, it won't be us!
We'll figure something out.
Torch it?!
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
It's the right thing to do.
Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
No we're not.
Then Sally comes too.
Why don't you get to the point.
Hello.
Yes.  Wife and a kid.  Don't blame yourself, Deputy.  You did all you could.  You have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks.
It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
Are you sure you're OK?
He's not, he's...
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
We appreciate that.
Why would someone do that?
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Did you say After Midnight?
We are having a sale on some items over here --
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I’m a busy man.
Sort of.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Well I'm here now.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
You'd do this to me!
Well, same ol' same ol'.
Are you hungry?
That's great Earl!
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
We're going to find out.
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
Two-hundred thousand!
I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
I got my sources.
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
They think I'm a crooked customs agent.
The real question is, where are the plates?  If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
Lee, you okay?
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take that one, too.  How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink.  She can do my feet.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
I knew you were lying.
You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
How you doin'?
Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
I have plenty of dates.
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
I'm okay, you go.
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
I cannot go to LA...
Who?
How do you know?
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
Well we're not friends.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
Yes.  We have heaven.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
What is Mac out?
Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
Just GO!
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
New York City?
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
Any leads?
It's my responsibility.
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
No.  Your father.  Your father and Ricky Tan were my favorite students... and for such awful things to happen as they did --
OK. Say what it is.
Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
Beach Boy America.  Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my --
It was not my intent --
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
Stooly.
Took off. Yes. They took off.
That one is my favorite.  Chicken puff with shark fin.
No, fish is a PM food.
Going into the restaurant.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Han?
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
Maintain eye contact.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
What?
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
All the gory details.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
Thanks.
Why do YOU think she ran?
Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
-- The luau for Maggie.
Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
Excellent.
You have one?
He is not!
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Five hundred.
You don't know.
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Yes I do!
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
I kissed him back.
Really?
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
I love you, too.
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
It's probably because you got him fired.
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
Why?
It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
No, no.  You're her best friend.
Is there somebody else?
Nope.
What am I going to do with a microwave?
It sounds nice.
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
I love you.
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
Walter, I'd love to --
Go for a walk in Central Park --
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
Well, I did.  And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect.
It's just like my grandmother's china.
I told you.  Nothing --
Not.
What?
"I want to meet you..."
I always wondered about that too.
Becky?
He said hello.
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
A sense of humor.
I know.
This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
Walter and I are engaged!
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
Sure you do --
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
Everywhere.  You can't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy's butt was cute.  Who the first babe to say this was I don't know, but it caught on.
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
This is going to be tougher than I thought.
What is it?
It's a spice rack.
It plays in 50 states.
Somewhere in the middle.
What?
I don't know.
Good.
WAIT!!!  -- "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore."  Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
I'm glad you liked it.  Good night, Jonah.
No.
It might be in the kitchen.
Shut up.
What about camping?
We ought to start camping again, Dad.
He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
You're kidding --
Look, I met somebody.  She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off.  We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
You look good yourself.
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
No thanks.
No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
There's nothing stopping you.
No, just the ring leaders. The fire-eaters. And the ones with big families ...  Barton -- where's that boy?
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
It never ends.
Yeah.
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
Later. When I finish the ironing.
Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
The safety of the men -- that's more important! Five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up. You're a woman, you don't know what it's like up there.
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
They say I am no good to you.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
Ramón -- you can't.
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Shut up, you're talking crazy.
Or why don't you just put a sign outside? "No dogs or women allowed!"
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
You mean Delaware?
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
The spiders.
Yeah.
What can I do for you?
Not even a guess?

You like that?
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
You don't understand.
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
You get off on abuse or something?
Because he'll kill me.
I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live.
How?
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
And you admire that?
I'm kind of busy.
He knows where I work.
I just can't. Okay?
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
Twelve
Why does it have to feel so bad?
You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer.
Yes, Jimmy
You aren't coming with me.
It don't matter. I'll do it. And you sure as hell don't have to pay me.
Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose.  Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?
No shit?  Fuck it.  I'll send it to Oliver Stone then. He'll get them to reopen the bastard.
Make me an offer.
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
Question is, what are you doing here?
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
This chink have a name?
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
To who?
Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
No.  You've got me all wrong.  I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
I thought you were done.
Where are your men now?
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
Not where I come from.
Shit, that was no big deal.
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
Say what, Cap'n?
It's worth it.
Senator's son?
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
Plenty.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
Goddamn it, sir...
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport.
I've got a line on one.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Good news?
Three for three.
Vecchio.
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
And what about your own hand?
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
Well, I, for one, like cheese.
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
Well now I'm saying we're moving out.  Get off your ass.
Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
Struggling with a pair of Germans.
Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
How can you, how can you say that?
Understanding the following rights...
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Okay, thanks.
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
But you never had a first date.
Hang in there, man.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
I can accept that.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
I'll put this past my boss
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
Tell me, is it bad news?
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
I'm fine.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
I swear to god.
Honey, about what?
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
This is me telling you about me.
Would you hold this for me?
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
You know what?
Basic.  Hmmm.
No, I'm serious.
Mmmm.
Well... just meet her.
Friends with potential.
Yeah.
This is so noble.
Then why are you shaking?
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
Your letter came yesterday.
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
Why didn't you tell me?
It was wonderful.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
No, I don't, I don't.
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
What do you want?
You do?
No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
What?
Jim Court... no, this is her father.  I'll take...
Fine Lloyd.
What?
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
I was just going to kind of move around.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
They're not gone, they're here.
It's bad business.
He's important to my business.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
I don't know.  Soon.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
Nice things cost money.
I don't know, ten or twelve.  That's a good color.  Dark blues, grays.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
How do you do?
What others?
Well, they wouldn't own it, I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product.  They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.
Stern.
There will be generations because of what you did.
You did so much.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
thought he was doing AA.
Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
That's okay.
Why aren't you there?
What if I said goodbye?
I had to change. Did anyone call?
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
What?
Do I know you? You look familiar.
What's your subject?
Let us decide that.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
Good question. You took the bait.
What guy?
Hope you’re ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
I see you read the book.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
What are we looking for?
Can we turn the light on?
We'd break some furniture.
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
Yeah, right.
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
You're getting obvious.
Are you in danger now?
The safety what? Fuck that!
I have to watch rehearsal.
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
I just love being a sister.
Closer than you think.
You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
Hello.
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
Good bye Ben.
Closer than you think.
Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
There's more.
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a third killer.  Sidney Might know something
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
Oh yeah, how?
I am Gale Weathers!
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
That's funny.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Just because you knew her?
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your   music video awards.
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
Who is this?
Go there.
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
You know it.
That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too?
No...
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
Fuck you.
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
Who is this?
I think you have the wrong number.
It happens. Take it easy.
Do you like scary movies?
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Don't...
To talk.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
I believe you...
Come on, yes you do.
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
Shit.
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
What's the delay?
I want to talk to you.
Kenny. Camera. Now.
And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
...out at the airport...
...so call if you need me.
Working, thank you.
You coming tonight?
There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
Which is you...
Are you serious?
Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Thanks, Tatum.
Later.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did.
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
So far it's all dead ends.  No credit history.  No employment history.  His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash.  We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane.  We may never know how he got that way.
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
I'm... I'm just delivering a package.
You'll see.
A woman...
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
You should be thanking me.
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
I realize that.
Drop it.
No one yet.
There's a bucket.  Under the table.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink?  Near the food?
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
And, if it's a threat.
None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.
It's got to be.
Just wait!
Bullshit.
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
No.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
We had him.
Then, he must write about these murders.
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
One birthday he gave me this brand new hardcover book, "The Century of the Detective," by Jurgen Thorwald.  It traced the history of deduction as a science, and it sealed my fate, because it was real, not fiction.  And, that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime... it was incredible to me.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
Where's the victory?
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
When do we get to question him?
There's no time to discuss it!
I can't let you do this...
I... I don't understand.
I can't do this now... please.
It surprises me.  It really does.
It's a hard place.
Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
Crime of passion.
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
You're my brother...You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to...Ain't that so, Martha?
What, Ben?
Huh...? No...no water.
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
I'm Clayton.
You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
That's what I said.
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
Ain't yours yet.
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
What?
Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
Nine...  Ten!
A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
Well I ain't one of 'em!
You'll never get away from me!
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
Oh, damnit!
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  "There is something negative about the place..."  What the hell are you trying to say?  Come on!  Spit it out!
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
You don't remember?
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
I don't know all about what happened back then.  But it always stood between me and my husband.
Does this dog here belong to you?
Lady?
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
And yet you tell me you lie with women?
Interesting.
Nothing comes.
Cut his nose off.
Partners!
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
A share of the profits.
How?
I don't know. It's a mystery.
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
It is all locked safe in here
As soon as I have found my muse
What piece? Richard Crookback?
Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
I liked the dog, for laughs.
Your Majesty.
And I love poetry above all.
"Madam!"
I am, Master Shakespeare.
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
No, the morning rooster woke me.
I must. I must
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
Orsino…good name
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
Write me well.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
I will do my duty, my lord.
Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.
And break her heart and mine?
Does she say so?
She sings too?
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
Can I show you something?
All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
Just stop worrying.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
I don't know anything about it.
Yes.
Yes.
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
Know and love?
So I gathered.
Maybe he didn't like us.
Unfeasible.
Who was it?
No.
It tastes different.
We have to talk.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
Can we come in?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
There are only two other people in the flat.
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
No.
With a face like this?
And you need your sleep.
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
You must be Juliet.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
Writing seems easy.
It's an improvement.
What?
Or a fake?
Chicken salad, Devra!
No.
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Then what's the problem?
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
No, doll, I listen to you. And if a deal loses money that's not so bad either if it's handled right.
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
No.
You mean that girl, don't you?
Calm down, baby.
We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house?
What about?
Why don't you see Lester?
Yes.
What about?
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
Don't be silly. I'll just tell Lester we were smoking a couple of joints. See?
Hello.
Gee, this is great.
Don't make conversation with me.
What?
You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
No shit.
It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.
Hey, I don't tell.
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
You did, I know you did.
-- what?
I am you, you little bastard.
He still having parties?
-- mmm --
Look who's talking.
-- you've got to leave.
Why?
Look about last night --
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
No --
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
I don't know -- I've got to.
What?
-- Oh yeah.
-- Otis?
-- oh -- sweetheart...
Not yet.
That's too bad.
What're you talking about?
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
I am?
Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
How did it go at the bank?
George.
I want your feelings about it.
I'll call you.
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
Who?
Television or movies?
Commercials.
-- well aren't you --
Bullshit.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Well that's something.
Oh, Christ.
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
Does it make you happy?
Well, baby, I'm George and it needs to be cut.  But I don't want to place you in that position either.
Well, yeah.
But what?
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
I know what you mean.
Oh Jesus Christ.
I wanna hear it from you!
Oh yeah...
No.
I'll call you back.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
I'm not jealous of the dogs.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Does she know about us?
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
It must be something.
Well, it's George.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
I would say so, yes.
What?
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
He's a hairdresser.
I don't think so.
You're going?
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
Oh that's no problem.  -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?
No.
Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
I guess so.
French Fries and Ketchup.
Tony.
How does he tell you things?
Try to think what it was.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Oh!
Yes.
No.
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
It's okay, really.
Yes sir.  Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...
Fine.
That's right, sir.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
Sure.
Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
Yeah, this is it.  How do you like it, Danny?  Is it big enough for you?
Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
Good evening Mr. Torrance.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
Your money's no good here.
Great.  Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through.  I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.
God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
I know it.
Good.
Yes.
Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?
Stay away from me.
Give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
I'm Jack Torrance.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
can of itself be a problem.
Great...
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
Eight thirty.
Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
Will you?
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
What?
A tracer. You'll like it.
You're not going to let it go, are you?
Will you do it?
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
You know what we're saying!
SING! SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!
SING!
Probation?
Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.
Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit the road.
Good evening, Vincent.
That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
Yes, Betty?
Why?
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
What a shame!
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
Like this place?
I... I...
What?
Really?
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
I don't want to mess anyone up...
Give me a C.  A C!
What's a concubine?
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
You have, I believe, some minimal background in music.  Therefore, you are to join our choir.
Out of the question.
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me!  They tried to kill me!  I'm not kidding!
You son-of-a-bitch!
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
I've been worried about you.
I have?
I think they'd understand.
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
Willy -- hit the lights.
For like, twelve zillion eternities?
Really...
A Benedictine.
Can you hold?  Can you try?
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
To place it inside its coffin.
What are you spying on?
You need rest.
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
Your superiors are two days away!
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
I shall, gladly.
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
Believe?
I did not ask you to, did I?
No, I couldn't...
Should we go back?
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Stay back.
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
What does it mean?
Did your father take a loan?
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
Are you so superstitious?
There is no such thing as magic.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
People have put their trust in you.
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
What did you say?
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
He moves too fast.
No.  She has gone out.
Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
Yes... yes.  I think I will...
What did you say?
Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
May I see my mother?
She is guilty.
She has confessed.
Karl, they's a blanket up in under that cot and soap in the bathroom to clean up with.  Now there's one more thing. The way we lock these doors at night, you can't get out. You didn't want to go anywhere, did you?
Well, yeah it's a classic. You know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about it last night and it's just not Christian of me to not let you have a key. I mean you been in lockup so long, you don't need me keepin' you locked up. You need to come and go as you please. Here, take this key, it'll get you in and out that back door.  Them french fries good?
You done fixed it? I'll be damned. Scooter told me it couldn't be fixed. 'Course Scooter's about as shitless as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be. You done fixed it. I'll just be damned. See you tomorrow.
Well, I ain't scared of him workin' here. You know me. I'm a church goin' man. Forgivin' man. When your time's up the Lord's gonna come git you. You seared of him, Scooter?
Good to know you, Karl.
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
Sure.
Naw, we don't have biscuits.
Yeah.
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done called him. He'll be here.  Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I need you to help me ice down a tub of beer, you and Frank.
It went real good.
No sir.
You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
Karl Childers just in from the state facility. Make one of them gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it is you do.  Oh well, Karl's a little retarded, he don't know what the hell I'm talkin' about. And to Vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients. Now that takes balls. Our number one tune for the folks, boys. Kick it off Johnson!
Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.
You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
What numbers do you punch?
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
I aim to kill you with it.
They're from the Dollar Store. I'm not an idiot. Besides we have a garden full of flowers.
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
Don't you live somewhere?
I did live there in the state hospital.
You told me to come by.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
I thought they was.
It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's self-defense. Was it self-defense?
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
I like the way you talk.
Yeah.
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
Yeah, I recollect it.
Naw.
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
It was fun, anyhow.
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
You better go get 'em.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Yes sir.
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
I didn't aim to.
No ma'am.
Right now?
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
So, you're really going to stay here?
That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
Will he be supervised?
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.
Better make it charge. 
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
What's that, Sol?
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
Thanks. I knew you'd understand.
How'd you get started?
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
He's crazy.
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
Anything good?
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
Eighteen and a half years.
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
She looks just like you.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
And you're giving it to me?
For keeps?
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
I almost got married once.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me. 
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
You mean Rashid?
I just want to know where he is.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else, Michelangelo. I got work to do.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
Yeah? And why is that?
So what's the time?
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
The what?
You can't be more specific than that?
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
What time is it?
Eight-thirty?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
Why don't you go to the police?
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
What time did you get to bed last night?
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
That money is my whole future.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
Carl Heine's type.
Why?  If they could never take title.
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Happy for him.  And relieved.
Well, it seems to me...
What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
And the last...?
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>.  Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
Maybe...?
The freighter started through at 1:42.  The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
I should show them an American?
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
No spare.
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
Possible.  But not darn likely.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
Not in those words.
Maybe we could run some tests.  Kind of a comparison, the old and the new...
Bye.
Why?
Bull fiddle.
Clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -
Funny?  In what way?
It's private.  Go away.
Those two musicians from the garage!
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
Yeah.  Why?
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
I told you - it's a sure thing.
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
It did?  Boy, did it ever!
So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
- Type O.
We're not too late, are we?
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
I never did like the name Geraldine.
Break it up, girls!  Daphne! Come on, help me!
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
Me?  After Sugar?
Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
And where's he going to be?
He's going to be ashore with you.
Security.
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
Okay, Joe.
But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
What do you think you're doing?
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
That's ridiculous.
Half-full.
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
Come on, Daphne.
I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
That's what I call a louse!  If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.
The Florida job?
You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
- you got to be blonde -
No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
You're not sure?
Wanna bet?
I'll throw up!
And I can never have children.
That's good thinking.  Daphne's a push-over for him.
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
You got to be under twenty-five -
You got it.  It's six dollars a man.  Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock -
Yes, we're the new girls.
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
Brains aren't everything.
Good night, Sugar.
I wish you'd make sure.
Who are you?
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
Up, up, up.
For your own amusement?
- opening of the Opera -
Shell Oil?
Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
It's been delightful meeting you both.
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
What's on Thursdays?
It's the crews' night off.
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
That makes me feel just awful.
Have you ever tried American girls?
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Show the gentleman to the chapel - pew number three.
Coffee?
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
I already told you.
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
But I’m not taking your name, buster. I’m a feminist!  I need icey! Mr. husband-man, get me more icey!
The wedding.  I am so, so bad! I don’t think I should be allowed to get married.
Hey.
And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her.
It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they haven’t made up since.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now she’s getting married.
Yeah?
Maybe not her least... There’s always--
So, what’s your point?
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in “share.” People do that.
He was pretty drunk, but I think he’s still crazy about you.
I don’t know.
What does your gut say?
It’s cute.
If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
Show me.
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
What?
Yup. That’s why you get to keep your money.
Oh, cut the crap!
You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasn’t one of them.
Make out with you for free.
What?! No, no. You can’t--
Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
You pawned it.
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
At least somebody’s using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
Colored.
What's his name?
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
Can you swim?
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
He'll show up one day.
Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
Guess I can't just lay here, then.
No, son -- they'd have to kill me before I'd let 'em do that to me again!
Goodnight.
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
No mam -- I looked all over.
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
Who's Miss Johnson?
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
Come in, children.
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
Maybe soon--
Is he gon' be gone long?
I'll wait till after the children.
Little chilly.
Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
I am the clitoris.
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!
Chef, do you know anything about women?
-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
Okay.
Yeah,  <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!</b>
Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
Whoops.
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
Eric, that is not appropriate.
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time.
Oh no, it's that kid.
What?
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
Dude, what the hell is going on?
You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
Boobie... This is the only way you're ever going to learn. I have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences.
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
We can't leave without you!
Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
It isn't fair!
Our moms suck!
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
Okay...
Me?!
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
Huh?
No, it was worse than that...
Hello, Brooke Shields!
Cheers, Terrance!
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Hey, come here, guy.
No I'm being serious! Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed. It is the seventh sign.
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
Cool!
Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
Oh yeah...
They're not going to make it!
Magnificent, magnificent.
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
Ain't it the truth. Must be good to be rich.
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Why, didn't they say?
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
I'd advise you to shut up and let me finish Taylor.  You needn't worry about the lifepods because they're all gone, jettisoned. Save for one.
Taylor, you surprise me.
Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
Good help is hard to find...
Let's get something straight, Chappy!
Just don't move around too much.
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Fat chance of that.  Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge.  That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.
Well maybe we can do something like that.
I don't know the condition of the compartments.  Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.
Even if we do, it might be too late.
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
I'm about to blow the wall.
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
And so far.
He's in the bathroom.
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
How can you sit there with your fat stomach and tell me to take it easy!  I want to go home!  I want to be warm!  I want to get out of here!
One moment please...  one moment please...
Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
Nope.
No. I'm from Akron.
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
What do you want with old man Faz?
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
Sheila, meet...uh...  I forget the name.
It's a beautiful thing.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
100 years! 
What do you think I can do?
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
My mom was there. She told me about it. The 'Fazeli Split.'
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
I didn't think so.
I am underground.
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
Who's there?
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
Who's there?
Someone wants to play with me?
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
I like the sport the way it is.
Leave him alone!
You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
Mine, and they never tip.
Won't your father help you with that?
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
I could let them go for ten.
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
Nope, I couldn't care less.
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
You got any broken bones?
I told him you were my boyfriend.
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
You should.
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
Fuck plan C!
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
I am a professional man.
What are you gonna do, call the bowling police?
Your time is up, busyboy.
Who identified the body?
What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
Forty yards.
Thirty yards.
Do you see it?
Pull it, damn it!
Anything else?
Nothing else.
Press?  No, I haven't.
From what?  What's with all the security?
Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
They didn't tell me anything.
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
What team?
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
Damn it, Edmunds?
No.  I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat.  He might be listening now.
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
It's not ignorant.
He understands me fine.
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
What is it?
Because when we get down there --
Wait -- down where?
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
My gosh, Norman.
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
Wait a minute.
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
And you didn't tell anyone?
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
No, I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm.
I have to reset the sub.
In case you die, too?
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
You think?
Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
Bingo.
How long does it last?
Not believing you.
How's Harry?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
He can't manifest.
You think I manifested the snakes?
But --
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
You think I care?  You think I care if I die?  Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself?  Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, I'm thinking about you.  Your safety. Protecting you from your own self.
Beth -- gimme the gun.
C'mon --
Beth --
I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
By the bunks.
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
You'd have to ask them.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
Like what?  I'm not --
We can refuse to talk.
Is it coming from our own computer?
Fine.  I'm fine.
Whatever I can do to help.
Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
What noise?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
You're clear.  You see the airlock?
Her suit's gone.
You didn't say that about the food?
Hold on.
I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Arrived?  From where?
It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
They're topside.  We're ready to take you home, sir.
No, they didn't say --
You've heard of me?
You mean you don't know?
Who's everyone?
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
I don't see anything.
You seen my suitcase?
How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
I think there are some things we should talk about.
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
We'll be back before you are, old man.
All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?
My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
How can you store an energy field within you?
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
He's bluffing...
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.
Yes, sir.
Was this trip really necessary?
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
I'd better go see how he's doing.
What are you saying?
Why?
All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
I don't know... I've never fought anyone.
No need, everything's under control.
With four casualties?!
If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
Something... I've got...you don't.
Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
Yes, sir !
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
What's the hurry ?
I'm getting better.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
You're upset, that's alright.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
I like it. It's kinda...you.
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
Sure.
Well, excuse me, sir...
All bands.
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
No, sir.
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
The information will not be disclosed.
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
That is how V'ger will survive.
By the Creator.
To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
May I ask Why?
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Mr Decker....
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
A tractor beam...
Viewer, standard ahead.
Aye, sir.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
Adjust parallel course, Navigator. Bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance.
Hold relative position here...
Viewer ahead, sir.
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
Tractor beam remains constant...
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Who?
Well, it had sentimental value.
It's...
It was either that, or a sardine.
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
Of course.
Goodbye.
...I always thought so...
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
About <u>conflict</u>...
No, I don't...
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
I don't drink.
Later on.
Why?
It used to be the Old Mill.
<u>Please</u>...
I hurt you?
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
...what...?
That's something a man could do...?
You know what else a man can do?
People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
Now you're talking...
But it'll stop the movie.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
...you think that's right...
I'm going to tell the truth.
After Drama Group.
Yes, that's right.
Well, then, what's he doing here?
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
That's right.

You got to get out of here...
She's a...
Joe, the writer?
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
The Mayor's outside.
Mr. Bailey.
I...
Claire, Bob Bar...
How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
I...I...
Who are these from?
I'm only trying to...
I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
Well.
Who got their heads cut?
Doug, the traffic light...
Doug...
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
Sure.
It burnt down.
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
I...?
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
I know the feeling.
Grace.  Get Mr. White a manual typewriter.  It's not a lie, it's a gift for fiction. And somebody find me my lucky pillow.
I grew up on your mov...
Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
I don't drink.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
For what cause?
Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...
...would you excuse me, please...
I don't...
You told me you were writing.  Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
Did you bring Bob's weights?
They're coming Fedex...
I'm gonna' bring it off.
55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...
How are you getting on with these fine people?
Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright?  We need a new title, we need a...
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
Pay her off.
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
He's got a gift for fiction.
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Waal, then, you know, you do whatever would make you happy.  Sher.  This is your party, and whatever...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
You think so?
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
Ain't no second chances in life.
Zat true?
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
During sex.
...why do you think?
Great.
I'm not.
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
Here.
I'm almost done making it.  Alright Ben -- <u>you</u> deal with the tardy, <u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy <u>told</u> you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
This is my daddy's house --
And this is my room so get out!
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
No, baby.  You're gonna use <u>my</u> words.
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
No.
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
Mommy?
If you want me to hate her I will.
That's Rache's song!
I helped.
Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
A lot smaller.
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
Look, I...
I didn't do it for you.  Believe me.
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Jackie?
Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
Ironic, huh?
And you said...
No.
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
Uh.  You hate my guts?
What do I have that you don't?
You're the hip and fresh.
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
Oh, yeah?
What?
He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look.
Thank you.
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
No.
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
You have a bay?
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
I am sure.
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
Yes, I know…But still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
We're not ready.
550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only in fifth grade!
What's tomorrow?
The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them.
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
You know he hated my story also.
Your story was terrible!
Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
The same.
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Toby Oxman.
Great!
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Gee, your Dad's smart.
I know.
You should be.
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
What for?
Prnceton.
Sure…um…yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Y-yes--
Well get someone down there!
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
Look Cooper I don't care what my father says, if you embarrass me here you're going to regret it, understand?
Who's got matches?
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
Used to Filmore, used to.
There's the fence...
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
The transmission is an hour old...
We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
I don't think you--grasp--the situation, Mr. Myers.
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
How much do they have?
Excellent.
I say we head out.
I have your word, Mister President?
It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
We have many splendidly deep mines in our country.
Give that back to me.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
What about the President?
Then why bother me with this nonsense? Get in touch with the base commander.
What kind of trouble?
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
Yes, sir.
Do you recognize my voice?
Condition Red!
A shooting war!
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
Yes, sir.
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
I'm trying to, sir.
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
Where, sir?
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
What the hell is Plan-R?
Mister President, to guard against espionage, the three letter of the code group for Plan-R are always selected by the lower echelon commander himself, just before each mission.  They are sealed in the various attack plans and are known only to the lower echelon commander and his deputy.  In this case the deputy is air-borne with the Wing, and General Ripper refuses to recall the planes.
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
Naturally I am, sir.
What's the target.
Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
We'll worry about that later.  Okay, I'll take damage reports.
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Some kind of signaling.
Can't "Ace" help you?
What do you mean?
Look, this is different.
Right.  So how could we get any messages?
Forget it.  Okay, team, let's break it up and get ready for the kick-off.
I asked you a question, Lothar!
I thought maybe you'd like some company.
Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
I don't anymore.
Sure, all the time, in Group.
In Group?
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
Yeah!
Yes.
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
You didn't get me in trouble.
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Yeah.
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
Good.
No, no.
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
Y- s-sure it did.
Erica is in the van back there.
What she doin' in the van, man?
What?
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Guess not.
Play it! Come on!
So, how was the ride, kids?
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Shit.
Alright, Pony!
Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.
No, you don't belong here. We were here before you.
Good. See you later.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Please.
Don't drop the guitar, man.
Yes!
Yeah!
It's nice here. It's different.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
What'd he get you?
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
Let's see.
What was your name again?
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
Because I'm alienated.
Who were you talking to?
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
Oh fuck.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
It's a piece.
Your sure as hell right about that.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
So you can give me more shit?
I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
About what?
One!
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
What? What do you stand for?
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Yeah.
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
Jeff. Jeff.
Us.
Come with me.
Mm.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
I, yeah.
God, you smell like whiskey.
To his hotel?
You're unbelievable.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
You did, huh? Good for you.
'Bye, Jeff.
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Yeah.
Yeah, I crash there.
No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
I don't know.
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
Look; okay, come on. Look, what are you doing? Look, that's enough. My wife called the police. They're coming.
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Hey!
It's stupid.
You do not!
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
Would I get paid?
Yeah.
Alright!
No, I'm going.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
Oh that's nice for you.
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
I just pulled and it - it came off.
It's twins!!
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
That's right.  So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.
Of course - of course!  Hands in...
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
We're here for you, Diane.
You sure I'm not fat?
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
Kim-Lo?
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
I guess there's an exception to every rule.
Bullets.
Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
Or that!  Look, you guys, I just want to provide a future for my baby.  I know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand.  I could open that safe in my sleep!
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Oh yeah, you caught us...
Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.
My best friend got pregnant.
Stop it!  This is crazy!
In a deep freeze.
Where's the bar?
I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
I didn't.
Thank you.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
He thinks it could be made into something.
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
From Artie.  What's wrong?
Come on in, Betty,
Gordon Cole... Look, Norma, I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.  Make yourself comfortable.
But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
It is not.  Get out.
Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
Uh-huh.
And you'll play Salome?
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
There sure is.
You can stay here.
You'll like it here.
I'll take care of that.
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
Okay.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
Just follow me.
You think this is all very funny.
"Mad about the boy."
What right do you have to take me for granted?
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
All right.  Give me this.  I need it for a moustache.  Now close your eyes.
He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
Good.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
Madame is waiting.
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
What doctor?
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
You made her a star?
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
What do you want?
Western Europe.
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
It's for your own protection.
You love me?
Yes. It reminds me of home.
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Tell me where I can find her.
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
I'm not mad at you.
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
She'll forget about us eventually.
She has hostages.
I'll come back as soon as I can.
And you think you're in love.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
Why George, are you proposing?
Oh, sure.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
Throw him out.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Cheap but effective.
Not yet.
That's home.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
What? Palace? Hardly.
Are you happy, Zaltar?
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
There's no vodka in it.
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
Brad Wilson.
The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Well, aren't you excited?
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
Could you get me Superman's autograph?
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
I know, I'm the fault.
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?

Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
Black or regular?
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
For what?
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
No, we're just going down.
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
And do what?
It was hot!
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
Thank ...you.
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster.
Where do you usually find a light switch?
He can have mine. Anytime.
Hello.
Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
Blizzards! Heat waves!
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
Where did it come from?
Uh. . .
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .
Everything on it.
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.
It's beautiful.
Why didn't you go before we left?
Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
We must combine our strength.
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
Don't worry, I've got you.
I'm sorry to see you go.
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce Superman's skin. He'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
Who?
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
A toupee that flies?
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
Bunkers!
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
He's thirty-five years old.
Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot.  It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and  --
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
Oh, for God's sake!
Supposing that man had hurt you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars, two credit cards, and a lipstick? I mean, it's not as if --
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
He's from another world.
When it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it.
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds.
Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
A night on the town instead of under it?
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
Of course I can. I love you.
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
He sure as heck does that.
Folks'll ask question.
Lara, please...
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
He will be odd, different.
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
Twenty-four.
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
Do as I say. Let go!
I came to talk to you.
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
It must feel great.
Can you really see through anything?
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
Ally.  That's right.
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Okay.
I don't know.
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
Billy, please.  The children.
Your kids never cry.
They can look forward to that.
I have to.
You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
No.  I saw it on his face.
What do you mean?
That's right.
Did his parents attend to that?
Did they give him special care?
He knows that?  Billy?
Hi, Dolores.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
I'll just strap it on the roof.
Away from your crazy Mom.
We've only got honey.
Isn't it a lovely day?
What happened to summer?
Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed.
Oh.
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
Yes.
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
The people in the town?
Yes.
You seem very sure about that.
I'm absolutely positive.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
She...she was a friend of mine.
...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
There's the Prescots...
What do they do?
Perfect.
I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
What for?
You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
Is there shrimp on it?
No.
You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.
Do you have this agreement with you?
In what way?
Why were you scared?
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
You could see the speedometer?
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
No.
The Ottos.
You don't know that.
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Is "he" inside?
Yeah, having supper with the Mrs. She's over there.
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
Son, you raise your voice again and you'll be outa here on your golden pratt!
Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
J.J., Steve isn't...
No.  I'm going home.
Susan!...
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
I don't?
Not "we", Sidney, you!
When?
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
Sidney, I know human nature.  Susie lied to me - she'll see that boy again.
What about?
You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you "interviewed"?
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
We stick in each others craw.
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
I didn't do anything!
No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
Steve, stop it please...
Why did you call me?
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie...
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
My mission is to protect you.
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
I would.
You told me to.
Prove it... stand on one foot.
Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone."
Cool.
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
Chill out, dickwad.
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
Drive faster.
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
No shit?
Alright, it!  We need it!
Ready.
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
Open the goddamn door!
No.
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
Some.
Don't. This is like a criminal investigation, David. Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks. They're all the same.
David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now?  Did you hear the question?
What museum?
Then you're going to kill me.
Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
May I ask a question?
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
Who?
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
Yes, von der Null.
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
I have no idea.
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Helmuth.
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
So. You wanted to see me.
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
One of your people told me.
Absolutely not.
What's it to ya?
Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.
The what?
Kyle.
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
Okay.  Talk some more.
About where you're from.
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
Good fighters.
It's better that way.
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Why?
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
I can't sleep.
Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
Remember Daniel Grant?  Do they say, "without Daniel Grant, there is no Baer/Grant Publishing?"  He's gone sailing, Alan.  He's out there enjoying his golden years, probably wondering where you are.
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
I said I was sorry...
What are you babbling about, psycho?
Why not?
If there was one.
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
They'll love that.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
I think not.
Hm?  Oh, yes.
Right.  Call me Christy.
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
All I mean is... someone like you...
We searched the house.
Nicholas...
Let me show you...
Julliard, yeah.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
Trust me.  Call that number.
Are you still on mediction?
I'll call them, okay?
I know...
What have they been doing to you?
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
How do you know?
This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
Robbed?
And, they didn't take that watch?
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
A game?
And if nothing's lacking?
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
Guess!
Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
Don't take another step.
The key?
No, you didn't...
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
Ilsa... you're alright?
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
I'm not sure.
He came to my mind recently, that's all.
Nobody worried about your father.
Goodnight.  Where was she?
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
Luke.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
But there's a sad catch to the story.
Good.
That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
That's why we're here.
That depends.
What's his first name?
Maybe you did it yourself.
Is that a problem?
It's not a knock.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
I'm sorry.
Italian.
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
I sure hope so.
Come over here.
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean?
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
Where abouts?
Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing <u>them</u>.  Checking <u>them</u> out.  I felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
Five years, I think.  Long time.
See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
No one else is even here yet.
You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
Not much -- you?
Well, those are the breaks.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Been busy, have you.
What was that, then?
Now who's being sarcastic?
She never told Eddie, though.
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
Something like that, yeah.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
Are you serious.
These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
Pushing the legal limit even then.
You ever been to London?
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
I know that.  But as time went on ... well, it <u>wasn't</u> a joke, was it?  She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for.  Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out.
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
Five thousand.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
That don't mean nothin'.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
Ah.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
Hello, Tony.
Geez, Mr Crane.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Did she make mistakes?
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
Huh.
Well, I'll be damned. The barber! And I thought this trip was a bust. Well...
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
She's a rare one.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
Please, Ed.
OK.
Told what?
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Dave.
I didn't say a word.
What happened to you?
You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
Honey...
Yeah.
I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
Yeah.
Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...
Huh?
This hair.
...You ever wonder about it?
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
Could you come with me please?
You'll go to the prison hospital.
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
What's the combination?
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
Mind if I have a look?
Whose footprints?
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
Everybody.  Get behind me.
What is it?
It's important.  Please.  You have to come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found out something.
Right.  The entire brain appears to have been extracted.  May I see it, please?
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
I'm not giving up.
You're right.
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
We will.
They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Like this.
Quiet.
What?
How about lunch?
No one knows.  The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
We need someone to take us to the secure storage area.
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
For what?
Viti Levu.  For how many?
It's the busy season.
No, hold back...
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
Certainly a nomination.
As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
Why not?
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
Now.
Yeah?  Outta what?
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
This is different.  Everybody seems to be in on it.
What's that?
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
That can wait.  I want to get away.  See some of the world.  Explore.
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Fine.  I'll tell her.
Yup.
A woman?  Work.
Does what?
Yes. I know.
Looking for him for what?
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
That's what I'm saying.
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
I don't either, but it sure sells books.
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
A plague?
You can't.
No. I haven't.
How's that?
Scully, I found the bomb.
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
What did you find?
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
Yeah, well they may this one.
General McAddie's.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Yes.
What about you?
This isn't Colonization, it's spontaneous repopulation. All our work... if it's true, then they've been using us all along. We've been laboring under a lie!
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
He needs to be turned over.
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
I know him.
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
I bet we can fix it.
Delano?
Initiating connection.
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
Absolutely.
Awaiting his arrival.
What about the cat?
Completely unaware.
It's his dog.
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
But you looked so cute.  All sleepy...
You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary.  I don't care.
He has a little dog.
His own doctor?
Whiskey.
Need we go through it all again?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
I'm so sorry.
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
You send me a wire as soon as you arrive.
Oh, well.
Of course.
Yes.
If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...
Good-bye.
Just around the corner.
Fellow called Lime.
September '39.
No, sorry.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
No, no. Leave them for a while.
Oh, Mr. Martins...
I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
I don't need a dentist. Somebody hit me, that's all.
Heard of Harry Lime?
Goodness, that's awkward.
Certainly.
She's been arrested.
Holly...
You've got plenty of contacts.
Coffee.
Zwei zwartze.
What did he say?
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Who else?
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
He didn't want to get involved.
Why no, Mr. Martins.
His name?
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
I think we're about half way.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
What happened?
Eh - bonsoir.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
One night I will get the perfect photograph.
Incredible.
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
Killing himself.
You can't.
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
That's stupid.
Yeah, it's stupid.  Put it on, or I won't teach you.
You shouldn't.
Do they?
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
Nothing. Let's go....
Did you see how they reacted to him?
Decentralized, nonviolent, increasingly mainstream. We'll see antiabortion, anti-immigration groups form alliances with the gun lobby, Christian identity types, tax resisters and even some libertarians....
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Why would Nadelman lie?
Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
Who killed Manzetti?
I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.
But I wasn't.
Think about your father. Your sister.
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
Steve's going to explain it.
Who told you that?
Can anybody imagine why I would say a Jewish prayer?
You could do it.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
What do you think you should have done?
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
So what?
I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they?
And let us say...
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
Does he know?
But your man isn't quite a God!
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
Congratulations.
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
What else is there?
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
I won't, I swear.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
"That"!  This is not a "that"...
The rules are the rules.
... What's your name again?
Try speaking to me?
No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
What?
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
Yes.
You don't have that one, do you?
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
I can't.
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
Lucky I was there to save you.
I'd better get back now.
No... tell me.
... Not at all.
Promise you won't forget me.
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
I know sir. I won't let you down.
You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke...Oh. I get it.
Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism.
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
No dipshit, I want you to kill him.
Why not -- if you like it —- if that's what you really want.
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
I drink.
And when you drink, you get drunk.
I sleep it off.
I don't know.
That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
All men are fools. They like to make a big show -— shout and hunt --
Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too —— when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people.  But these last weeks will always be our secret —— a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
Hey —— I'm over here.
We're old friends.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
Just barely possible - - yes.
To the eye? Like other men.
No.
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
Ask Kiki. Ask any woman. Girls don't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark, lonely street unless they're with a man or expecting a man.
I'm sure of it!
On his back, I suppose.
You. Us.
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
I got into a little crap game.
Must it?
I work here, sir. I’m here most of the time.
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Can it be that you want your brother found?
You... You found that at Leon’s?
Look, Mrs De Moraes, however much of a let down it might be, your brother’s not back to his old weekend tricks! Impressionable as he is, he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses, tried moving on to bigger things, came upon more than he’d bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world. Which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table... Have a look at it, Mrs De Moraes. I told you I had bad news...
Get out of my house. You’re fired, Mr Lombard.
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
Paul Lamont...?
Aren’t you curious to know about Friedman?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. What’s harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
My brother hung himself.
Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
Good.
...We’re turning in circles.
And you still haven’t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
Where is that?
I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didn’t have any. I used a British passport. My name’s not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
By your Austrian?
I thought you’d never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... There’s a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it won’t be for a couple of hours.
Like you’ll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round?
Who’s the guy? Who’s the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I’d have had to kill him.
I saw the ad at George’s.  I’m passing through town and I’m in a hurry.
This is a bad line.
What sort have you got?
Yes... Good, good...
Have the money ready by 11am. We’ll call you.
Yeah... This morning. He left this fucking bloody morning... Jesus, man, my knees...
Where?
What kids?
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I’ve got to get to...
How are you, Jane?
Well, I hope you’re not too heartbroken and...
I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry. 
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  My husband...  My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is.  My son-in-law, Carlos...  The gentleman is a business partner of his. 
Must I speak to you in French?
Look Mrs Spitz... I don’t know to whom I’m indebted for the recommendation but... I’m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Check with your son’s bank. Banks don’t usually give out information about their customers.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
I’m overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where they’re not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
Could someone have hurt you that bad?
Hyatt... Friedman’s... at the Hyatt...
Three o’clock.
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
I’m sorry...
Shut up! Where’s your wallet?
Can I get up now?
Haven’t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I’d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
You-you’re wrong. I just called to ask if I could stay with him next time I’m in London. That’s all.
He just said he had good reasons.
Good reasons?
I’m afraid I don’t understand.
I’m sorry. It’s just you don’t look local...
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon’s story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
... No.
Excuse me?
Fucked-up fucking weird.
Où est passé ton salon?
A l’achat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais ça pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. C’est pas vraiment mon truc.  I don’t know any Austrian, Xavier.
Then why don’t you reach him?
Fuck...
That’s just it. The sonofabitch didn’t ask for help from his colleagues...  Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasn’t gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
I can only tell you what he told us...
What sums?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as “Never Forget”. Over the years we’re talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
What do you think?
That's a good idea, sire.
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
10,000 gold crowns.
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
Louis... water and fresh straw!
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
Because there's an arrow in your leg.
But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
No, but...
To marry you.
It would not be the same without you.
But... why... what's the point?
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
One day you will.
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
But that was her order!
Yes, probably... maybe...
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
Scared of a girl?
Am I... am I dead?
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
How old are you?
Not unless you hear my confession.
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
What did it tell you?
Did it give you advice?  Good advice?
Silence her!  Take her away...!
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
If she comes from Burgundy it makes a difference.  It might be a trap...  Look... Signed "X".  What sort of name is "X"?  Or must we conclude that a messenger of God can't even write her own name?
Go and ask him yourself.
His face.
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
Oh, but I forgot!  It was a Sunday... that explains it.  God's day off.
For weeks you've been asking for this... well now you have it!
No...
That's now what I meant...
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
If you kill him, you kill me!
How many did he give you?
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
God asked you to do something?
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Do you think this cross will protect you?
Are you sent by God?
Let's see.
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Oh yes, she's... wonderful.
Jeanne, be patient.
Yes.
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
It's nothing.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
Don't worry, it won't last long.
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
Who told you?
People I know. They said you're an important man.
No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
That's better than yesterday.
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
Hungry.
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Dirty pig!
I was listening, Kitten.
Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
Where are we going?
I'm not going anywhere.
Watch your feet!
No, it was a table.
Baines is packing up?
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
You don't want to learn.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
No, not words.
Hello.
That's right.
I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall. 
At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third.  Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
Hell no, I just cut into him.  I woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes.
No.  Never saw him before.  He's a dick, though.
I had some appointments.
What?
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
That's the way I want it.
Then why ain't he dead?
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
Wasn't no problem a mine.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
All he's gotta do is read.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
I'll take him anyway.
We'll get by without 'em.
No, not a thing.
You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.
Yeh.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
Where you goin'?
I don't know.  Depends what train I get on.
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall.
You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.
He cheats.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
Then why the rat?
Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger.  I want you to help me break him.
It's foolproof.  We got a partner downtown runs the central office of the Western Union.  Race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies.  All he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner.  Then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that's already been run.  It can't miss, unless the Western Union Dicks get onto it.
You want your money back?  Try and get it in a court of law.  C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll make it worth your while.  Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
He was?
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
Why not?
Why did that man want to kill him?
Nothing.
And if it isn't?
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
You're high enough.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Probably not.
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
There. 
Why... in the heart.
Which way did she fall?
You see how much we have to say.
This is my wedding.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
Nothing.
What'd he think it was to you?
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
I think we're on the right track.
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
Extraordinarily lucky.
Did you go?
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
I guess all the suspects are here.
You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties.
Just give me a minute....  I'll remember. I'm not stalling, Lieutenant.  You know I always come clean with you.  Gee, it'd serve me right if you had pinched me...  that's the afternoon I was.... wait, I'll show you...!
Chris -- Chris -- !
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
Go ahead!
I never had it.
Is Julia going with you?
No.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
That's all right.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
I had him out this morning.
Oh, this is Andy --
You got types?
By the way, how is your father's side?
We need ice.
Room service, please -
At breakfast.
That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
You did.
Who's that?
Macaulay.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Oh take it!  Please take it!
All right, hard guy.  Get up and bleed on the rugs.
Looks like a hold-up!
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
You bet I wouldn't.
Goodbye, darling.
I did find him!
That's a fact.
Wynant's body?
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
Couple of months anyway.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
Yes!
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Got a nice evening dress?
It's the only way it makes sense.
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
You worked here?
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Police!
He's a good guy.  He sent me up the river once.  Hey, Nick!
Bonds, sir?
I know I left them there.
Y-yes.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.
Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
Weird they didn't chase us.
Ready when you are.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
Then get up and do something about it.
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
You don't know that.
I've got no stomach for murder.
So you can give us away?
It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm killing Iraqis.  At-at-at-at-at.  At-at- at-at--
Blow me.
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
Wait.  Wait.
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!
It's the only way.  We drive!
We're going to be right over here.
It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
Stay low.
Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
Get up off your ass and dig!
He's not going to leave us.
Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not.
You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it.  We're heading Northeast.
How!?
We'll find our way!  We'll...
What if he's not?
We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
And you; you've got it all together.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
Yeah.
I don't want to die.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
I never had anything before, Epps.  I never was anybody.  Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins.  When I was in high school I used to--
Just let me rest for a second.
Yeah, I guess we should.
Probably.
They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on. Come on!
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
And then shoot them.
Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.
I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
The...the gold...
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
But...
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
How the hell should I know?
He'll slow down.
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
People are suffering.
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
What?
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
Looks like dirt.
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
No!  Don't go.
But...you...
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
They're watching us now.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
But you can't.  We must escape.
Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.
Where's LUH?
It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
You're in violation.
I don't feel well.
I'll report you.  It's....
What?
But you can't...you.
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
I'm only trying to help you.
What do you want?
You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
Yes...
Thanks.
No thanks, Bev.
Only once, at Redstone.
I don't know. You tell me?
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
Would you?
Nothing.
Stay to your left.
Make up your mind, trigger.
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
We've created a monster.
I know. I warned them.
What? Nobody, I-
We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
Insurance?
IRA - instant retirement account.
I'll do it.
Goddamit, Reilly--
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
Yes.
Well, have you found it?
No!  But let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
Very well, Jacques.
No.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
Monescu.
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of Constantinople?
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
Lily-- 
Leave me alone! You were willing to sacrifice a hundred thousand francs for her.  Well--  she's worth it! [ You were willing to pay a hundred and twenty-five thousand for a <u>handbag</u>. You can pay a <u>hundred</u> thousand for him!]
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
Then you go into the foyer.
What's wrong now?
Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll write you the check immediately. 
You're hired!
Then riding together.
How do you like my dress?
Beautiful.
Like that!
Any minute I want!
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
Because I want to make it tough for you.
But I don't want to be a lady.
Please! 
Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police?  I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, "Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!" 
It could have been marvelous ...
I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
Yes, that's the trouble with mothers. First you get to like them and then they die.
Well--uh--yes and no.
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
No--I'm sorry.
You're certain?
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
Don't drop it Rose.
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
She knows.
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
Sure. Count me in.
Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
No you won't.
I know what ice fishing is!
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
Jack.
You're welcome. Rose.
Worse I'm afraid.
Yes, exactly!
May I?
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
You're right. Only you can do that.
I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it.
He couldn't have.
See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.
That's enough.
Would you like anything?
I should like to see my drawing.
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.
That's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.
And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh--  --when she's had time to tidy up a bit.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
--and I can tell you where to get off.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
I think you do.
Isn't that interesting?
No-o!
What did you want a gun for?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Sure!  Excuse me.
I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
When?
Sorry.
That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
You said it! How about a little action?
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
Make it five.
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
What's the matter?
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
How're the tips?
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Much better--thank you--
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
Why?
Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
What's that?
If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard-- 
Sure.
No. <U>Knots</U>!
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
That's fine.
All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--
Never mind.
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Yeah--
Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here. 
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
Very--
Somebody's got to do it--
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
So what?
Eh?... Oh.
He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
--you'd go with him!
You can't bluff me any more.
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
Nothin--  --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
Ain't got time.
Hey--you! Where you going?
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Then why did you run away?
Because you ran after me.
A peace officer... Impressive man
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
Beauty, ain't he?
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
Here it come: one-two-
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right As the mail.
Better.
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Ignore her?
Sorry, sorry...
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
Then what do I do?
Run.  Take that girl and start Running.  Run and don't look back. All your life you been running And looking back and just barely Existing and calling it getting By.  This time run and don't look Back and call it living.  Live Every second, live it right up to The hilt.  Live, Wyatt...  Live for me.
You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.
Colorado's closer
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
I laugh sometimes
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
You feel bad about this?  About me?
Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here?
All right, well, good night.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher.
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
Drop his horse.
They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.
Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
Morg, use your head.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing.
Well I'm real scared.
Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-
So to speak.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
You'll never make that stick.
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
Wyatt...
I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.  Darling! Come here.  I want you to meet my wife.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
What about the gold?
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
Nothing.
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
Well... If you insist.
Gone fishing.
Hey - the world is my office.
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
Hell. The CIA built that club.
Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
You too.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
So charming! So suave!  Don't insult me. I'm not one of your 'little London girls' who falls for the lies.
What?
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
My father left me the business.
Up.
... We have time for that?
If not?
A three-thousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air.
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Remind me.
Mandarin. You jerk.  I'm late. I have to get dressed.
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
The Queen invited you to dinner -
Chew up a log like that in the propeller, you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to London. Twice.
My timing always was lousy.
It's Bond!
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
Abort the cruise.
What did your wife get her?
We got the same thing.
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
They're too big.
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
My name is Sam. Samuel.
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
He will be alright.
Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
What for?
I'm going back home with Harry.
I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
I'm not here to argue, sir.
I don't know how two brothers can be so different.
It would be nice.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
How is the garden doing?
I cut it on an old rusty knife.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
Well, I don't want to put you out.
Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time.
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
You must have done something to her.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
You invited me.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
Where is Skip?
Oh, yeah!
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
Let's let Molly open one.
T-O-Y.  Toy.
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
No.
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Alright Buzz, get ready...
Shield your eyes!
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
Yeah, right.
Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
No she's NOT --
Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
Nothing.
Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about.
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
Okay, thank you.  At ease.
I can't quite make out -- 

Sh-h-h-h-h!!
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
She got away.
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
I can't go home because there's no home left.
Ah, you should see the swan! His masterpiece. Now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell.
You're only a young thing.
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
Finn ...
Everything is gone, now.
In the play. She was married, by my age. And Mummy. Mummy wasn't much older than me when she got married. Well, not <i>that</i> much older.
What? Did you let that child play with one of my toys? I don't like children playing with my toys.  Have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. Give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
Well, I hope it stays that way.
How much do I pay him?
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.
Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.
Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
So's the video camera.
Honey, your father knows the President.
I don't know.
What's up?
Will we get invited to the White House?
I'm third in my class.
He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
Yes, mom --
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
She knows Arnie Metzger.
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
No --
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
We can protect you.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
Yes, sir!
I don't know.  Something.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
I feel like a traitor.
He'll do what I say.
When he loves me like a father, he will never tell anyone he was here. He will freely give the names of his superiors.  Then we get them and they too will give us names.  And eventually somebody will get us to Juan Obregon and the cartel will fall.
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
You don't know what the hell you're talking about.  You're a cocky seventeen year-old and you don't have a clue what the stakes are. You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away.  And neither does she.
That would be very helpful to me.  Also, I received the offer from DEA and the FBI to train some of my men at Quantico.  I think this will be extremely useful, a good way for us to absorb some of your methods.
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
Christ.
I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK?
You were in my way.
Thanks.
Where's that?
It's where I live.
Great.
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Right. You can't sleep here.
Jesus.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
No.
Smells like it.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
Cheers.
Yeah.
And you might get the fucking job.
Nightmare.
Who wrote it?
Give me the gun.
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
Say something, Mark, say something --
It wasn't that bad.
You know.
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
Such as?
It's fresh air.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
Closing.
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
And that is?
I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
Are we leaving, Captain?
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Goodnight, Bones.
What do you mean?
Mr. Sulu. Execute.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
He did have pointed ears.
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
I am here, Captain.
To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
But I thought Captain Chekov..  I see. Very clever, Captain.  Spock, it would appear that you've been given a second chance to join me. What do you say?
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
I'll take you to the bridge.
I'm afraid of nothing.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
Am I? We'll see.
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...
Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.
Sybok, we must find a way...
Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
Did he say why?
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going?
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
Oh. Anything else?
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
Hmm. A difficult proposition... difficult proposition at best.  Perhaps you've noticed... we're not exactly packing them in these days ...
Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
Where did you hear that name?
You're alive!
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
Stranger and stranger...
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
How 'bout yourself?
Tron...?
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
Alan-One...
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
But-what if I can't...?
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
We have to get off this beam!
I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady.  You never used to lie to me.  But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
Unbelievable!  Trent told me he wrote it.  He's history.
Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
Son of a bitch!
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
You didn't have sexual relations with him?
Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
I don't know.  I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.
I wasn't cheating!
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
Okay.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
Well I pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server...
I can't, honey.  I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.
Not because you were attracted to him?
Well, maybe a little.
I needed to feel alive.  I wanted to do something...  outrageous. And... I don't know... it felt good to be needed.  To be trusted.  To be special.
I love him.  I have always loved him and I will always love him.  Can I go home, please?
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
She's really a fox, isn't she?
Absolutely.
And you've got one.
Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this.
It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
Find out who this Renquist it.
Hello, Alabama.
Knock wood.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Oh, hush up.
Ya looked through it?
Get it.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Is that your real name? Really?
Sure. Why not?
I love to get pie after a movie.
What do you want to know?
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
What's your favorite color?
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.
Almost four years.
That dazzling imagination.
Will you be my wife?
I don't believe so.
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
Write down Drexl's address.
Why?
You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address.
Cancoon.
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
I heard that.
In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun.
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
It's great to hear from you.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
No shit? Dick, that's great!
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
The police department?
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
I guess so. Follow me.
Yeah?
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?
I really don't know.
Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.
What makes you think I would do that?
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.
No.
Uh-huh.
That was a good fuckin' movie.
Sure was.
I believe he believes him.
We talked him into it.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
Or a supporting actor -
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.
He saw the wire.
Just put it in your purse.
No way, JosÈ.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
Put it in your pants.
Read my lips.
Do you live here?
Where's that?
You're still a little... disoriented.
Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
Change what?
Do you know what year it is?
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
You have to give yourself up, you know.
See -- you can drive after all!
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
Flowers!  What flowers?
In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
I need to make a telephone call.
A lawsuit?  You going to sue them?
Not, "what", babe!  When!
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
Who am I supposed to shoot?
Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
You're insane, Jeffrey.
Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.
You want something?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I said I was sorry.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?
You want to make a kiddies bet?
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
I need a ticket.
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
You son of a bitch!
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
There you go, sweet talking me again.
We ain't got no Beck's.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Taking a little trip?
He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
Yes, I have.
You're welcome, Grace.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
You've been around.
Like you.
Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
Jake.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
How much money has he got?
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
Stop it.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
There has to be!
Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
Like you don't know.
Would you kill her?
I did?
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
What should I do?
The time wasn't right.
You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
No.
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
I came for Grace.
You came to take my wife from me?
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
What are you babbling about?
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of.
I said come on!
Got any requests?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
I've had time to get over it.
Oz.
What's your name anyway?
Will you shut up!
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
The old lady?
A hundred-forty-five really.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
But, Senor--
That's 'cause he's dead.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
That a fact?
Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
I'm her husband.
You broke my nose!
Yeah...
I do.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want?
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
I've had time to get over it.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
But you was going to fight for me.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it.  And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, <u>who knows me</u>.
Darrell.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
You got the money?
That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
No.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
Do you have to call me that?
Accident.
No trouble at all, really.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
Drove into Superior?  What for?
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Thank you.
I guess it must.
Where'd you learn to do that?
Come here.
What?
Still playing?
Did you ever?
Walk away.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of-a-bitch.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Because I know you're full of shit.
I could if I had Jake's money.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
What are you talking about?
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else.  Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.
Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.
'Cause I love you.
Harlin's.
Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Where to?
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
I'll fuckin' take it. To go.
What was that all about?
Well it's about time. Looks like you found yourself a helper too.
They look nice.
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
Is Noel in?
I had to put him down.
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
It means we're probably to tired to remember.
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
We're supposed to be honest.
You've misunderstood.
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
Why'd you do that?
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
I'm not scared.
Is that right?
Did you get up from your seat?
...And everyone lived happily ever after.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
We was... lyin'.
What you gonna do when somebody comes to collect?  FUCK 'EM? FUCK 'EM A THOUSAND TIMES?  The kind of people who'll come after that thousand, they won't tolerate if you don't have it. They won't just cut your face up a little.  STUPID CUNTS!
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though.
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?
About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
Oh.
I don't never see nobody anyhow.
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
Easy, Kid, easy.  Now, you hear that, Ned? The Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?
What business?
He's in there.
Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
Sally?
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
No. I mean...  ...an' get yourself a woman? You know?
Beats the hell out of me.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
Tom?
All that money... I mean... did you...?
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
We done that stuff.
Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
Yeah?
Bear with me here...
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
Just forget about it.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
I don't want to know.
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
They fucking know everything.
Doubtful. With all that coke, they'll be ready - which brings me to sunny spot number two. Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we get nothing.
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
Fenster and Hockney?
Just do what I tell you.
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
I work for Keyser Sate.
We'll see.
I've got a ton of work and no good people.
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
I know he was good.
He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
I don't.
You think he's..?
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
What did he find?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
Yes.  It would be.
Gruber...
What does it mean?
Say it.
Yes!
Frank Galvin.  We've met before.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Your Honor...!  Your Honor...
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
Just as you are, Sir...
No.
...of Anesthesiology?
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
We just ...
You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
Yes.
That's perfectly all right.  I'm kind of rushed.  Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
You're going to settle out of court?
... the case with anyone.  And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony ...
To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
Ready, your Honor.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
What?
I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin.  Let's not waste these people's time.  Answer the question, Mr. Witness.  Please.  Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
How come you're calling me from...?
Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
I changed my room at the Hotel.
And what are you?  A cop?
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
Laura.
Maybe I can do something right.
That's what I'm going to try to do.
What happened...?
...and is that serious?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
Today is Tuesday.  What?
Mickey:  I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
That's right.
What did she do?
I don't want a mistrial.
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
... I know.  I went ...
... fifty thousand dollars?
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
Yes.
Yes.
Yes...
Yes.
What did she say?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
A single hour.
Yes.
Yes, that's correct.
...of the procedures...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
How'm I doing so far?
Should I?
I married into it.
How long have you been back?
San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
It's not my line.
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
Yes.
But you knew about this.
Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair.
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
She... went into the Bay.
No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.
Who you are --
-- and how you happen to be living here.
But before! Where did you live before!?!
I'll take care of you.
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
We tried it. It didn't suit me.
Why?
Scottie --
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
Not at all, I enjoyed --
Well... anywhere in particular?
The oldest living things?
Only silence. It's always like this.
And no birds sing.
The tall trees...
Where?
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
What do you remember?
How do you know?
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
Tell me.
Let me go.
Why?
Oh, yes!
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
It wasn't your fault.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
My... the acrophobia.
That!?!
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
You haven't told me everything.
I've told you enough.
Out!
Mmm, yeah, I guess...
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
No, not exactly. Want to see?
But you said grey, sir.
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
Name one.
You're not a team player.
What are you fucking talking about?
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
Go home!
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
What?
We can't do this.
I am not flexible on this.
I can't do this.
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
Are you solid with that?
I know and I'm honored...
If anything ever happens to me...
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
Well, oh...
So where's that leave us?
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
Call 911.
Shut up.
Nobody knows.
So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
You always were a jealous man.
What you just said. Say it again.
You got a nasty side to your thought process.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
The hell I did!
Oh really? Starbucks?
You have a King fantasy.
Then what do they have?
Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders.
He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
We're not goosed.
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
Are we supposed to?
The wedding cake check?
You can't play around with these tent people.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
Charles Moore for instants.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
I need your help.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
Well I do.
Well you should.
Just a bit of organizing.
Okay.
Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. I just...we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business.
No way.
No.
Do you love me?
What are you talking about?
You fucked a prostitute?
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
What money?
Like how?
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
I just want her to be happy.
The wahoo?
I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things.
What?
A move?
Downstairs in the closet.
That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
Oh I know that. How does it go...
You know,  Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me.  Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.
The post-Vegas Man.
We will.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
That one.
No.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
Go away! Leave me alone.
But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
She won't even know.
If everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours.
Fifteen yards.
That's fifteen by seven?
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
I know that you used to work with an architect.
Leave him alone.
I'll be ready.
No.
I wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want ... I'll leave it to you.
What's he called?
Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through.
Don't say that.
Why not?
There's been an accident.
Yes -- very, very big!
A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me.
I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
I've had a gutful of this.
It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
Me? What did I do?
Jesus Christ.  I know who the dominant personality is.  Lindenmeyer.
Catch him and your record's clean.
Then I guess we're even.
If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
You think he's smart?
Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is.  But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming.
Got it.
What's the assignment?
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell.
Don't remind me.
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
What I need is a nymphomaniac.
How should I know?
Then fix it.
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
I think I understand what you have in mind...
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
I've been in prison, remember?
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
As a matter of fact, it is.
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
You're not capable of it.
Lindenmeyer?
Duck!
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
Do they have to look so...robotic?
Okay.  Okay.  The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb...
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>.  You see? His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of....
What rig?
What are you talking about?
...that's the general idea.
<u>Who</u>?
...<u>nothing</u>...
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...
... they're checking the ratings...uh...
...take a long view.
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
<u>So</u> forth...
Knock on wood.
<u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u>, somethin', <u>I</u> dunno... he...
Fine. 
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
Oh.  Hell.  And what do we do now?  What do we do <u>now</u>? Boy Producer?  Mister Win-an-Emmy, Social Conscience, <u>Whaleshit</u>, save- the-rainforest, Liberal hire-a-convict <u>shithead</u>? Mister Affirmative-Action Peacnik.  Commie... <u>shithead</u>....?
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
Dashes and Dots.  And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code. And that message is, "Courage, Mom..."  And he got the message through. "Courage.  Mom..."  Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."  Ladies and Gentleman, we will not <u>treat</u> him like an Old Shoe, we...
...how ya feeling, boy?
S'only got to hold for another few days.
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
I'll play your silly game.
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship... 
Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
I'm sure they do.
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
"Back End" ... count on it.
It's not too <u>clean</u>...
What do you mean he won't do it?  He won't do <u>what</u>?  He won't do the sp...  It's what?  It's <u>corny</u>?  <u>Corny</u>?  Is that the word?  Of <u>course</u> it's corny.  We wouldn't have him <u>say</u> the flippin' thing it wasn't corny.  Put... listen, it's not a question, we're locked <u>in</u> to this speech.  NO We're, Are You Listening?  LOCKED IN.

S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
What am <u>I</u> gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do?
Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.
What <u>kind</u> of stuff?  Hello...?
He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
Get on the phone, have'em fly in a ...whaddaya need to be a citizen?  A Judge?  Whaddaya need?  A Judge...? Call in a <u>Judge</u>, call in a Federal <u>Judge</u>, and...  If you're concerned about him, being an ..."immigrant." Make him a <u>citizen</u>... Eh?  <u>Guys</u> ... what's all this <u>mopery</u>, we...
I'm looking for a phone...
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that.
Deal's changed.
That's <u>one</u> thing, but I'm not gonna let two dickheads from <u>Filmschool</u> take it... are you <u>Nuts</u>?  Are you <u>Nuts</u>?
You like it?
Yeah, good good good good good.  And They're <u>So</u> <u>Secret</u>...
Cause the beans, y'know, y'can tell if they're <u>puttin</u> stuff in it.
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
They don't know what's going on!
Oh really.
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
Forget charts! We're not fund managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn 'em. I'm offering you the Knicks and chicks. God save you before you turn into poor Steeples over there.
Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back. Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders.
Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that.
Alright. Why so pissed?
Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
What are you doing here?
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
I don't know anything!
Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
Yeah, right...
Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.
I don't understand.
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
How much?
Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...
It's over you, Gordon.
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
You got it, G.G.
Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
Yeah, yeah, OK
What's that?
Thank you Jenkins
Thank you
Jenkins!
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
Mom.
You guys are being real assholes
Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.
I started seeing things.
A ghost?
Then why did you?
Fine.
You think you influenced her?
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
I am.
Who's that?
Um...
Who?  Your husband?
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
That's not...It's not like that.
I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
He was so pissed.
Oh God...
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
You got it.
I don't know.
Shhh.
M-E...
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Something was there.  You saw it.
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
Why?
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
I don't know...
Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
Nice.  Almost done.
I am, really.
Nope.
Mmm.
Tomorrow.
Remember how we were?
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
It's what I've been working for.
Is it gone?
Of course.
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
You didn't?
Did you call about the Feurs?
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from here, believe me, I...  All right, look at this.
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
Tonight?
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
Sweetheart--
Wouldn't go that far.
How did she know where it was?
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
She can't be here without me.
I know.
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...?
Who is this...?
I under5tand.  All the same
I'm coming down there!!  And it you put my mother in the ground betore I arrive, you'll wish you'd never seen my face!  IS THAT UNDERSTOOD...?!
Better than most, I suppose.
ENOUGH!!!
You - are - a - murderer.
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
uh - then he - be just -
You bastard...
Go away!  I don't want you here.
Do not tell me that!
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
I love Michael...
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
Tell me what I am, Rowan.
It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
Captain's orders.
All I meant was -
Mad. for each other.
What's wrong..?
What about you coming down here...?
I've come home, Michae1, for the first time.  I want to stay here - with you.
They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
That's GREAT!
Guess so.    I keep thinking about the witches - when I was... down there    There was - caring.  They saved me, Ro.  They said 'go back'...  Wel1-  I came back - to you - to love you.  I like seeing it that way, y'know...?
Their what...?
Mm-hmmm...
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Mm-hmm...
Mm-hmm...
Your beneficence.
A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
Go ahead.
You bastard!
Go away, GODDAMNIT!
You really love this guy...?
I've decided not to open a practice here  I want to set up a research clinic.  For infant genetic disorder.
Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
Yes - I have had it for years.
I think I will pass...
I'm a dentist
And how long have you been a dentist?
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
I don't want to talk about it -
I don't know...
then why did you marry her -
Why should I?
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
No thanks - 
I'm your landlady
You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
At home alone - where were you?
Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer...
Astronomical.
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
Dead?
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.
God, I love being dead.
We reinvented ourselves.
And I was wondering.
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
Yeah? You like?
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
That was code for "I like you."
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
We love our lives just the way they are.
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
Hi ho, Silver.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia." Just to show my appreciation.
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
It's not up to me.
Just a formality.
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
I didn't forget.
Me-ow.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
In what sense?
I'm trying to help.
I guess.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
To the best hiding place in the world.
If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
Let's do it.
I'm trembling with excitement.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Maybe someday.
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
You're sure?
It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
I'm just a messenger.
She's going to wash your Jeep?
Thanks.
I'd like that.
What about the blood?
He was large?
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
Suzie Toller is missing.
Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
Lombardo's settlement?
I net a guy in a bar.
Where's the body?
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
I guess.
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
Yeah.  But I got my bike.
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
You can trust me.
Nothing.
No you don't.
A friend of mine bought a boat.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
So you got my mom's money.
But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
No little girl can ever make me come.
Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
What's that supposed to mean?
Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro.
Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way.
It doesn't look like it.
I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
Shut up.
Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
No, no.  Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play.  We'll go through it all again tonight.
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
You need that real often?
Try what?
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
What about the explosive?
It's a repeating steam cannon!
I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
And people are actually fooled by that?
I adjusted it.
My pleasure.
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
Would that include me?
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Nicely said, sir.
And now the job's yours.
Dr. Loveless?
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
Yes!
For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
They're coming.
When are they coming?
I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...
It's a matter of great importance to me!
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
Miserable Pecks.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
Are you a warrior?
Of course!  I promise!
Elora Danan!
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
You?
Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream.
Ahhh!
I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle...
Are you scared?
Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!
You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
I don't know much about him.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
How are we going to get out there?
I've seen pictures.
Pretty much.
Yeah.
So one of them got to him.
Maybe.
Who else knows?
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in –
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Home.
Can I have something to drink?
Only the elders.
But you can't.
Buttons are Hochmut.
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
I know.
Say again?
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him –
I don't know where he is.
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Do you presume to criticize the....
Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.  And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Uh-huh.
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
Oh-oh-
Yes.
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
Oh, come on.
Huh?  What'd he say?
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
The other side....
Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Don't you start it, too!
That's right.
This way!  Come on!
Whozat?
Not nohow!
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
We do.
It's a whozis?
Well, I --
So who are you?
Who’s she?
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And M’s life is part of the bet.
Just wanted to put him on edge...
Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
The doctor who saved him couldn’t get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, he’s a dead man.
They’re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I can’t help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
The inside man?
I know.
I don’t want to be safe!
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
Not interested.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
Bond, I’m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family’s, now it’s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship.
A rope!
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
How appropriate.
Of course...
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
Cured, yes.
No.  I just wanted you to --
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
What is it?  How does it work?
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
Memory lane.
You and me.
What are you up to?
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
The costumes.  Am I right?
That's because --
Everything's changed --
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
What new information?
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
What about you?
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
What weapons do you have?
He gets to be the hero.
Mind your business.
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
What's that?
You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Viktor! Stay the course.
I thought that was in detail.
You're serious?
I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the house.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
Its core?
For what purpose?
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south entrance.  Jean and I will go in here.
You know, you --
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?
What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
How?
I'll go.
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
Is it enough?
From your office, sir.
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
... No!
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
Love me oodles and oodles?
Yes.
May I have it, please?
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
What?
One week at the most!?
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
Nineteen, sir.
What hump?
The wockers with the knockers.
Did you hear that strange music?
What?
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
That's not bad.
Thank you, Master.
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
Yes, master.  Just don't turn on any radios.
Who are you talking to?
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
You can say that again.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
What did you find out?
Someone was playing this in the music room.
How do you know it was a 'he'?
That's what we're paid for.
Soo -- pah doo -- per.
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
A god?
Yes!
Raise the platform, hurry!
Me?  Sing?
Good night!
I see what you mean.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
And I have mine.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
Four
My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
I'm explaining my reasons.
Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?
Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
